0:01:03,410 --> 0:01:06,660
改编自玛格丽特 杜拉斯的小说

6
0:02:44,230 --> 0:02:48,400
情窦初开时 我误入歧途
Very early in my life,it was too late.

7
0:02:48,440 --> 0:02:51,770
到我十八岁时 过失已无法挽回
At 18, it was already too late.

8
0:02:51,810 --> 0:02:54,020
十八岁那年 我老了
At 18, I aged.

9
0:02:54,060 --> 0:02:56,560
这衰老是残酷的
This aging was brutal.

10
0:02:56,600 --> 0:03:00,020
我看着它爬上我的面胧
This aging, I saw it spread over my features ...

11
0:03:00,060 --> 0:03:02,270
一点儿一点儿
one by one.

12
0:03:02,310 --> 0:03:04,730
我非但没有为此恐惧
Instead of being frightened by it ...

13
0:03:04,770 --> 0:03:07,190
反倒望着我的脸日渐衰老
I saw this aging of my face ...

14
0:03:07,230 --> 0:03:09,270
象是在读一本书
with the same sort of interest I might have taken, for example...

15
0:03:09,320 --> 0:03:14,110
津津有味
in the reading of a book.

16
0:03:14,150 --> 0:03:16,770
我保留了那张新的面孔
That new face, I kept it.

17
0:03:16,820 --> 0:03:18,940
面部的线条没有改变
It's kept the same contours ...

18
0:03:18,980 --> 0:03:21,520
但内涵毁掉了
but its matter is destroyed.

19
0:03:21,770 --> 0:03:24,570
我的脸是一张毁掉的脸
I have a destroyed face.

20
0:03:26,110 --> 0:03:28,070
请允许我再讲一遍这段往事
Let me tell you again.

21
0:03:28,110 --> 0:03:29,990
我还不到十六岁
I'm 15 1/2.

22
0:03:30,030 --> 0:03:33,280
在湄公河的一条渡船上
It's the crossing of a ferry on the Mekong.

23
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:33,670
看看我那时候的样子吧
Look at me.

24
0:04:33,710 --> 0:04:35,670
我还不到十六岁
I'm 15 1/2.

25
0:04:58,420 --> 0:05:00,920
正准备渡河
It's the crossing of the river.

26
0:05:00,970 --> 0:05:03,680
返回西贡
When I go back to Saigon ...

27
0:05:03,720 --> 0:05:05,970
象是在旅行一样 ...
it's as though I'm on a journey ...

28
0:05:06,010 --> 0:05:08,510
尤其是在我乘巴士的时候
especially when I take the bus.

29
0:05:08,510 --> 0:05:11,970
那是暑假后返校的日子
That day, it's the end of the school holidays.

30
0:05:12,010 --> 0:05:14,640
我不记得是哪次暑假了
I don't remember which one.

31
0:05:14,680 --> 0:05:17,510
我去了沙沥市  和我的两个兄弟一起度假
I went to spend it in Sa-Dec with my two brothers ...

32
0:05:17,510 --> 0:05:20,140
挤在妈妈的小房子里 ...
in my mother's tight house ...

33
0:05:15,510 --> 0:05:20,660
沙 沥 小 学

34
0:05:20,180 --> 0:05:22,510
在沙沥小学的后面
behind the bush school ...

35
0:05:22,510 --> 0:05:25,680
家里每天充满恐怖的气氛
in the horror of the Sa-Dec house.

36
0:06:02,730 --> 0:06:04,270
大块的是我的
The big pieces are mine.

37
0:06:11,570 --> 0:06:14,150
为什么是你的？
Why yours?

38
0:06:14,190 --> 0:06:16,650
因为这是规矩
Because that's the way it is.

39
0:06:16,690 --> 0:06:18,030
你去死好了！
I wish you'd die.

40
0:07:33,500 --> 0:07:34,880
保罗？
Paul?

41
0:07:39,340 --> 0:07:40,630
保罗？
Paulo?

42
0:07:47,010 --> 0:07:49,010
保罗 回来睡觉吧
Paul, come to bed.

43
0:07:51,130 --> 0:07:53,720
你什么都不用怕了
You mustn't be afraid anymore:

44
0:07:53,720 --> 0:07:56,260
不用怕皮埃尔  什么都不用怕
not of Pierre, not of anything.

45
0:07:57,380 --> 0:07:59,300
再也不用怕了
Never again, you know.

46
0:08:00,390 --> 0:08:01,890
再也不用怕了
Never again.

47
0:08:21,640 --> 0:08:24,180
他回来了？
He came back?

48
0:08:24,220 --> 0:08:26,020
我看到他在阳台 ...
I see him on the balcony ...

49
0:08:26,060 --> 0:08:28,560
在外面过夜
sleeping in the night outside ...

50
0:08:28,560 --> 0:08:30,060
不想回房间
doesn't want to go to his room.

51
0:08:30,060 --> 0:08:31,640
他太怕皮埃尔了
He's too scared of Pierre.

52
0:08:34,100 --> 0:08:37,020
我  我是担心他在外面过夜
Me, it's when he's outside that I'm afraid.

53
0:08:38,900 --> 0:08:40,560
担心他离家出走
I'm afraid he'll leave like that.

54
0:08:40,650 --> 0:08:42,100
他会迷路的
He'll get lost.

55
0:08:42,150 --> 0:08:44,520
这样的孩子很容易迷路
It can happen with that kind of child.

56
0:08:44,560 --> 0:08:46,810
你说得不对！
That's not true.

57
0:08:46,860 --> 0:08:48,350
你才不担心保罗！
You're not afraid for Paul.

58
0:08:48,400 --> 0:08:50,690
你只担心皮埃尔
You're only afraid for Pierre.

59
0:08:50,730 --> 0:08:52,230
你为什么这么爱他 ...
Why is it that you love him so much ...

60
0:08:52,230 --> 0:08:55,480
却从来不爱我们俩？
and not us ...never?

61
0:08:57,230 --> 0:08:59,730
我爱你们三个孩子 一视同仁
I love all three of my children the same.

62
0:08:59,730 --> 0:09:02,190
你说得不对  不对！
That's not true. It's not true!

63
0:09:02,230 --> 0:09:05,070
回答我 你为什么这么爱他 ...
Answer! Why is it that you love him so much ...

64
0:09:05,070 --> 0:09:06,400
却不爱我们俩？
and not us?

65
0:09:11,070 --> 0:09:12,490
我不知道为什么
I don't know why.

66
0:09:21,570 --> 0:09:22,740
昨天 ...
Yesterday ...

67
0:09:24,070 --> 0:09:26,410
我写信给西贡 ...
I wrote to Saigon ...

68
0:09:26,410 --> 0:09:28,780
要他们遣返皮埃尔
to ask for Pierre's repatriation.

69
0:09:28,820 --> 0:09:29,990
什么？
What?

70
0:09:30,030 --> 0:09:31,990
我要把他送回法国
I'm sending him back to France.

71
0:09:32,030 --> 0:09:33,700
你高兴了吧？
You're happy?

72
0:09:33,780 --> 0:09:36,830
他又去烟馆偷鸦片了
He stole at the opium den again.

73
0:09:38,700 --> 0:09:40,870
我再没钱付给人家了
I can't pay any longer.

74
0:09:42,200 --> 0:09:43,200
该结束了
It's over.

75
0:09:46,330 --> 0:09:48,160
不能再这样下去了
It's not possible anymore.

76
0:09:50,810 --> 0:09:53,960
沙 沥 小 学

77
0:09:56,870 --> 0:09:59,620
妈 赶快  要发车了
Mom, hurry up, or I'll miss the bus.

78
0:11:02,870 --> 0:11:16,620
沙沥－永隆－西贡

79
0:11:13,270 --> 0:11:14,770
拜 保罗
Bye, Paulo.

80
0:11:33,230 --> 0:11:35,400
路上小心
Take care.

81
0:11:35,440 --> 0:11:37,110
懂了  妈
Yes, Mom.

82
0:11:37,190 --> 0:11:38,900
你什么时候回来？
When are you coming back?

83
0:11:38,900 --> 0:11:41,400
狂欢节的时候  我跟你说过
For Mardi Gras. I already told you.

84
0:11:41,400 --> 0:11:43,230
噢  我忘了
Oh. I forgot.

85
0:11:57,900 --> 0:12:00,230
西贡\143公里

86
0:11:59,570 --> 0:12:03,650
就这样 我在那天返回西贡
 So that day I'm going back to Saigon.

87
0:12:03,700 --> 0:12:07,990
我穿着我的舞鞋 戴着我的男士帽
I'm wearing my cabaret shoes and my man's hat.

88
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:11,900
那时候整个殖民地没有一个女人 没有一个年轻姑娘
No woman, no young girl wears a man's fedora ...

89
0:12:11,990 --> 0:12:14,700
戴男士礼帽
in that colony in those days.

90
0:12:14,720 --> 0:12:17,040
本地女人也不戴
No native woman, either.

91
0:12:17,070 --> 0:12:19,970
那顶帽子我从不离身
That hat, I never leave it.

92
0:12:19,990 --> 0:12:23,070
它是属于我的 － 这顶帽子
I have that, this hat.

93
0:12:23,120 --> 0:12:26,070
只要有了它 我就是完整的
That all by itself makes me whole.

94
0:12:26,080 --> 0:12:28,200
没有它 我永远不是完整的
I'm never without it.

95
0:13:35,550 --> 0:13:39,650
于是 我乘坐永隆和沙沥之间的渡船
So it's the crossing ...

96
0:13:39,790 --> 0:13:43,090
横渡湄公河的一条支流
of one of the branches of the Mekong on the ferry that's between Vinh Long and Sa-Dec

97
0:13:43,090 --> 0:13:46,510
这里被称为印度支那南部的
in the great plains of mud and rice ...

98
0:13:46,550 --> 0:13:48,600
泥巴和稻米大平原
of southern Indochina ...

99
0:13:48,600 --> 0:13:50,600
鸟之川
the plain of the birds.

100
0:15:32,290 --> 0:15:35,410
打扰了 小姐  您抽烟吗？
Excuse me, mademoiselle. Do you smoke?

101
0:15:38,290 --> 0:15:39,620
不抽 谢谢
No, thank you.

102
0:16:01,300 --> 0:16:02,840
对不起
I'm sorry.

103
0:16:02,920 --> 0:16:04,590
一位年轻的白人姑娘乘坐土著人的巴士
It's so surprising ...

104
0:16:04,590 --> 0:16:08,170
实在令人吃惊
a young white girl on a native bus.

105
0:16:21,470 --> 0:16:24,930
我喜欢您的帽子  很有创意
I like your hat. It's original ...

106
0:16:24,930 --> 0:16:27,930
年轻姑娘戴男士帽
a man's hat on a young girl.

107
0:16:32,430 --> 0:16:33,930
而且您长得漂亮
And you're pretty.

108
0:16:33,930 --> 0:16:36,430
可以为所欲为
You can do anything you like.

109
0:16:41,930 --> 0:16:43,300
你是谁啊？
You're who?

110
0:16:47,180 --> 0:16:48,020
我住在永隆
I live in Vinh Long.

111
0:16:48,020 --> 0:16:49,000
永隆什么地方？
Where in Vinh Long?

112
0:16:50,600 --> 0:16:54,970
就在河边上  那所带平台的大房子
On the river just outside. The big house with the terraces.

113
0:16:54,970 --> 0:16:57,100
那个绿石头的？
The blue stone one?

114
0:16:57,140 --> 0:16:58,560
对
Yes.

115
0:16:58,600 --> 0:17:00,640
那是中国人的房子
It's a Chinese house.

116
0:17:00,730 --> 0:17:03,100
我是中国人
I am Chinese.

0:17:04,190 --> 0:17:06,140
中国人
Chinese.

118
0:17:06,230 --> 0:17:09,100
他就是那伙儿搞金融的少数民族
He's from that financial minority ...

119
0:17:09,100 --> 0:17:11,810
殖民地的所有房产业都是他们的
that owns all the popular housing of the colony.

120
0:17:11,850 --> 0:17:13,600
他去过巴黎
He's back from Paris ...

121
0:17:13,650 --> 0:17:16,650
在那儿学了点儿经商知识
where he undertook some business studies.

122
0:17:16,730 --> 0:17:22,770
他就是那天渡河去西贡的人
He's the one who was crossing the Mekong that day towards Saigon

123
0:17:23,940 --> 0:17:27,820
如果您需要 我可以开车送您去西贡
If you want, I can drive you to Saigon.

124
0:18:04,950 --> 0:18:06,780

Do you know her?

125
0:18:06,830 --> 0:18:08,780
她是总督的妻子
She's the administrator's wife ...

128
0:18:15,330 --> 0:18:17,120
嗯 谢谢
Yes, thank you.

129
0:18:29,500 --> 0:18:31,910
那个年轻人为了她自杀的故事
Is it true, that story about the young man ...

130
0:18:31,960 --> 0:18:34,790
是真的吗？
who killed himself for her?

131
0:18:34,790 --> 0:18:35,790

Don't know.

134
0:18:49,300 --> 0:18:51,040

0:19:33,260 --> 0:19:35,260
我抽烟您不介意吧？
The smoke doesn't bother you?

137
0:19:35,260 --> 0:19:36,760

她在宿舍一丝不挂走来走去

永远都不知道他们长什么样

大人们说我们要好好学习
They say they want us to study ...

208
0:28:02,910 --> 0:28:04,200

她们让我们寄宿 ...
They take us into boarding ...

他扯去那条裙子

扯去那条白色的小内裤

266
0:38:59,530 --> 0:39:02,070
到了床上
Once on the bed ...

267
0:39:02,150 --> 0:39:04,320
他却被恐惧所压倒

268
0:39:04,320 --> 0:39:05,650
我不能

他说那不是真的 ...
He says it's not true ...

So ...

273
0:39:31,660 --> 0:39:35,160
她成为主动的一方
So she's the one who does it.

283
0:40:16,550 --> 0:40:20,210
除了性的部分
other than that of the sex.

284
0:40:20,300 --> 0:40:22,460
她不正视他的面孔
She doesn't look him in the face.

285

0:42:27,410 --> 0:42:29,870
那个寒酸简陋的地方 我至今历历在目
I still see the place of distress ...

291
0:42:29,910 --> 0:42:31,790
象水底的沉船 ...
shipwrecked ...

292

那个屋子非常阴暗
The room is dark.

297
0:43:01,920 --> 0:43:06,590
外面喧闹声不绝于耳 ...
It's surrounded by the never-ending clamor of the town ...

298
0:43:06,630 --> 0:43:10,710
屋里的人仿佛掉入车水马龙的漩涡之中
carried away by the town, by the flow of the town.

299
0:43:10,760 --> 0:43:13,550
在那片噪音之中 ...
My body was in that public noise ...

300
0:43:13,590 --> 0:43:18,410
在门口的路人面前 我的裸体一览无遗
this passing by from the outside ... exposed.

301
0:43:19,860 --> 0:43:24,090
象是人的海洋  我心里想 ...
The sea, I thought ...

302
0:43:24,180 --> 0:43:26,340
铺天盖地
the immensity.

303
0:43:38,390 --> 0:43:40,930
你在想什么？
What are you thinking about?

304
0:43:44,760 --> 0:43:45,930
他们死了
They're dead.

305
0:43:58,600 --> 0:44:00,520
疼吗？
Did it hurt you?

306
0:44:02,180 --> 0:44:03,430
不
No.

307
0:44:10,270 --> 0:44:11,390
你很难过吗？
Are you sad?

308
0:44:14,400 --> 0:44:16,190
是的 大概吧
Yes, I guess.

309
0:44:16,230 --> 0:44:18,060
有一点儿
A little.

310
0:44:18,110 --> 0:44:19,690
我不知道
I don't know.

311
0:44:24,440 --> 0:44:28,230
那是因为我们在白天做爱 ...
It's because we've made love during the daytime ...

312
0:44:28,270 --> 0:44:30,400
而且天气非常炎热
in the dead of the heat.

313
0:44:31,440 --> 0:44:33,230
不是
No.

314
0:44:33,280 --> 0:44:34,730
是因为我
It's me.

315
0:44:36,110 --> 0:44:38,320
我总是有一点儿难过
I'm always a little sad.

316
0:44:40,610 --> 0:44:42,070
就象我妈妈一样
I'm like my mother.

317
0:44:43,860 --> 0:44:45,280
我告诉她我希望当一个作家
When I told her I'd be a writer ...

318
0:44:45,320 --> 0:44:47,320
她耸耸肩膀
she shrugged.

319
0:44:47,360 --> 0:44:49,360
她说那样不行 ...
She said it's not work ...

320
0:44:49,360 --> 0:44:51,240
说那个想法很幼稚
it's a childish idea.

321
0:44:51,280 --> 0:44:54,700
她要我学数学 我妈妈教数学 ...
She wants me to do maths, my mother does ...

322
0:44:54,780 --> 0:44:56,200
好去挣钱
to earn money.

323
0:44:57,740 --> 0:44:59,700
你想写什么呢？
What do you want to write?

324
0:44:59,780 --> 0:45:00,910
写书
Books.

325
0:45:00,950 --> 0:45:02,240
写小说
Novels ...

326
0:45:02,280 --> 0:45:04,240
写我的哥哥
about my elder brother ...

327
0:45:04,280 --> 0:45:05,740
把他杀了 ...
to kill him ...

328
0:45:05,780 --> 0:45:07,740
看他受苦 ...
to see him in pain ...

329
0:45:07,780 --> 0:45:09,490
让他死
to make him die.

330
0:45:10,790 --> 0:45:14,200
写我的弟弟 救他
About my younger brother to save him.

331
0:45:14,290 --> 0:45:16,240
还写 ...
And about that--

332
0:45:16,290 --> 0:45:19,580
写我妈妈的难过
about my mother's sadness.

333
0:45:19,620 --> 0:45:22,340
写她如何缺钱  写她的羞耻
About the lack of money, about shame.

334
0:45:23,200 --> 0:45:25,080
我知道你妈妈运气很糟糕 ...
I know the bad luck with your mother ...

335
0:45:25,120 --> 0:45:27,040
知道她经历的悲剧
and the tragedies she's lived.

336
0:45:27,080 --> 0:45:29,370
你怎么知道？
How do you know?

337
0:45:29,410 --> 0:45:31,430
我的佣人说的
Through the servants.

338
0:45:31,470 --> 0:45:33,080
还有我的司机
Through my driver.

339
0:45:34,210 --> 0:45:36,710
通过佣人 你什么都能知道
You know everything through the servants.

340
0:45:40,080 --> 0:45:42,670
我也知道你哥哥
I know about your elder brother, too.

341
0:45:42,710 --> 0:45:47,170
我在河边的烟馆见过他
I met him in the opium dens along the riverside.

342
0:45:47,210 --> 0:45:49,000
他烟瘾很大
He smokes too much.

343
0:45:50,210 --> 0:45:52,710
简直太大了
Much too much.

344
0:45:52,800 --> 0:45:54,710
白人不懂怎么吸大烟
The whites don't know how to smoke.

345
0:45:55,920 --> 0:45:57,380
他不是人
He's an animal.

346
0:45:57,380 --> 0:45:59,210
他让我害怕
He scares me.

347
0:46:00,710 --> 0:46:03,710
他偷妈妈的钱去吸鸦片
He steals from my mother to go smoke.

348
0:46:03,710 --> 0:46:06,090
他还偷佣人的钱
He steals from the servants.

349
0:46:06,130 --> 0:46:08,300
妈妈始终不吭声
My mother never says anything.

350
0:46:08,340 --> 0:46:09,550
妈妈最爱他
He's her favorite.

351
0:46:12,170 --> 0:46:15,130
父亲死后 家里没钱了
Since my father died, there's no money in the house.

352
0:46:16,970 --> 0:46:18,880
妈妈把什么都赔光了
My mother lost everything here.

353
0:46:20,320 --> 0:46:22,590
她的所有选择都是错的
She made all the wrong choices.

354
0:46:24,800 --> 0:46:26,550
那你们怎么办？
So how do you manage?

355
0:46:28,640 --> 0:46:31,510
我们只能尽力而为
We do the best we can.

356
0:46:31,560 --> 0:46:33,100
我们顾不上羞耻
We're shameless.

357
0:46:34,640 --> 0:46:37,140
只能尽力而为
We do the best we can.

358
0:46:47,470 --> 0:46:51,430
你来这里 是因为我有钱吗？
Did you come here because I've got money?

359
0:46:51,480 --> 0:46:52,980
我不知道
I don't know.

360
0:46:56,140 --> 0:46:58,640
我来是因为我喜欢你
I came because I liked you.

361
0:47:01,060 --> 0:47:03,770
如果我是穷人 你还喜欢我吗？
Would you like me if I were poor?

362
0:47:05,690 --> 0:47:08,150
我喜欢现在的你
I like you the way you are ...

363
0:47:08,150 --> 0:47:09,650
有钱的你
with your money.

364
0:47:45,490 --> 0:47:49,160
我想带你走
I want to take you away.

365
0:47:49,200 --> 0:47:50,320
我愿意带你走 ...
I'd like to take you away ...

366
0:47:50,360 --> 0:47:52,450
和你一起生活
live with you.

367
0:47:52,490 --> 0:47:54,320
我现在还不能离开妈妈
I can't leave without my mother yet.

368
0:47:54,370 --> 0:47:56,950
我还太小
I'm too little.

369
0:47:56,990 --> 0:48:00,620
我不能离开妈妈和弟弟  现在还不能
I can't leave my mother nor my little brother. Not yet.

370
0:48:15,000 --> 0:48:18,000
我要他一次又一次地做
I had asked him to do it again and again.

371
0:48:18,040 --> 0:48:20,790
为我做
To do it to me.

372
0:48:20,830 --> 0:48:23,080
他做了
He had done it.

373
0:48:23,120 --> 0:48:28,250
他在血泊中做
He had done it in the unctuousness of blood.

374
0:48:28,290 --> 0:48:31,500
我认为他对此习以为常
I think he's used to it.

375
0:48:31,540 --> 0:48:33,500
那就是他的生活 －
This is what he does in life--

376
0:48:33,540 --> 0:48:36,130
爱  别的都不操心
Love. Nothing else.

377
0:48:36,170 --> 0:48:37,790
我非常幸运
I'm very lucky.

378
0:48:37,840 --> 0:48:42,960
那好像是他的职业
Obviously, it's as if it were a profession he'd have.

379
0:48:43,000 --> 0:48:45,420
他在我上面 ...
He's on me ...

380
0:48:45,460 --> 0:48:48,420
他又一次爆发
he engulfs himself again.

381
0:48:48,460 --> 0:48:51,920
我们就那样守在一起  合为一体 ...
We stay like that, nailed ...

382
0:48:52,010 --> 0:48:55,260
在街头的喧闹声中呻吟
moaning in the clamor of the town.

383
0:49:11,010 --> 0:49:13,470
你知道吗
You see ...

384
0:49:13,510 --> 0:49:16,760
这个下午会让你终生难忘 ...
you'll remember this afternoon all your life ...

385
0:49:17,970 --> 0:49:20,760
即便你忘了我的相貌 ...
even if you've forgotten my face ...

386
0:49:20,800 --> 0:49:22,260
我的名字
my name.

387
0:49:26,390 --> 0:49:28,890
你说我会记得这个屋子吗？
Do you think I'll remember the room?

388
0:49:30,850 --> 0:49:32,890
好好看看它
Take a good look at it.

389
0:49:41,390 --> 0:49:42,930
和别的地方一样
It's like anywhere.

390
0:49:44,770 --> 0:49:46,560
这就对了
That's it.

391
0:49:46,600 --> 0:49:49,060
永远不会变
It's like always.

392
0:50:23,490 --> 0:50:26,610
我搞不懂是什么力量 ...
I wonder how I found the strength ...

393
0:50:26,660 --> 0:50:29,910
让我能如此平静 ...
the forbidden with this calm ...

394
0:50:29,950 --> 0:50:31,910
如此坚决地偷吃禁果
this determination ...

395
0:50:31,950 --> 0:50:34,870
我又是如何成功地 ...
how I succeeded in going all the way ...

396
0:50:34,910 --> 0:50:37,070
完全实现了我的荒诞念头
to the end of the idea.

397
0:50:37,120 --> 0:50:40,120
如何独自一人 从这个陌生男人那里 ...
How could I have taken so much pleasure ...

398
0:50:40,160 --> 0:50:43,490
获得如此之大的快乐？
for me alone with this unknown man?

399
0:51:31,750 --> 0:51:33,170
我妈妈 ...
My mother ...

400
0:51:33,210 --> 0:51:36,170
她要是知道了这件事 会杀了我
she'll kill me if she finds out the truth.

401
0:51:36,210 --> 0:51:38,170
我哥哥 ... 他会杀了你
My brother, he'd kill you.

402
0:51:38,220 --> 0:51:40,170
无法想像 ...
Imagine ...

403
0:51:40,210 --> 0:51:41,970
和一个中国人
with a Chinaman.

404
0:51:47,090 --> 0:51:48,760
从我很小起 ...
Since I've been little ...

405
0:51:49,640 --> 0:51:51,760
妈妈就告诉我在殖民地 ...
she tells me that here in the colonies ...

406
0:51:51,840 --> 0:51:53,540
一个姑娘如果不是处女了 ...
a girl that isn't a virgin anymore ...

407
0:51:53,560 --> 0:51:55,460
就再也找不到丈夫了
can no longer find a husband.

408
0:51:55,520 --> 0:51:58,220
你说 真的是这样吗？
Do you think that's true?

409
0:51:58,260 --> 0:52:01,390
是的  你母亲没有说错
Yes. Your mother's right.

410
0:52:01,430 --> 0:52:04,590
如果发生了那种 ... 丢人的事情
It's no longer possible after that--

411
0:52:04,640 --> 0:52:06,680
就不可能了
that dishonor.

412
0:52:07,280 --> 0:52:08,580
比如说 ...
For instance ...

413
0:52:08,820 --> 0:52:10,880
如果我想娶你 ...
if I wanted to marry you ...

414
0:52:10,920 --> 0:52:13,090
这将是不允许的
well, it would not be allowed.

415
0:52:13,100 --> 0:52:15,560
我们绝不能容忍这样的想法
We can't tolerate the idea of that.

416
0:52:15,790 --> 0:52:17,520
我是中国人
I'm Chinese.

417
0:52:17,570 --> 0:52:19,300
对不起
I'm sorry.

418
0:52:19,300 --> 0:52:21,560
既然你已经和我做了那种事
Now that you've done that with me ...

419
0:52:21,600 --> 0:52:24,800
我们之间就不可能结婚了
marriage between us would be impossible.

420
0:52:26,550 --> 0:52:29,300
这样啊 ... 那再好不过了
Well, then, it's for the best, then.

421
0:52:29,300 --> 0:52:32,300
中国人 － 我不怎么喜欢中国人
Chinese--I don't like Chinese very much.

422
0:53:12,690 --> 0:53:13,850
嘿
Hey.

423
0:53:15,810 --> 0:53:16,940
嘿
Hey.

424
0:53:18,310 --> 0:53:19,730
我可以到你床上去吗？
Can I come into your bed?

425
0:53:19,770 --> 0:53:22,150
不行  现在不要
No, not now.

426
0:53:24,110 --> 0:53:26,650
我明天再告诉你
I'll tell you about it tomorrow.

427
0:53:39,570 --> 0:53:41,780
是怎么了？出什么事了？
What's wrong? What's the matter?

428
0:54:02,260 --> 0:54:09,420
越南法国国立中学

429
0:54:08,160 --> 0:54:10,490
她为什么上那部新轿车啊？
What's she doing in that new car there?

430
0:54:21,500 --> 0:54:22,580
您好
Hello.

431
0:54:55,750 --> 0:54:57,750
等等 等等
Wait. Wait.

432
0:58:09,300 --> 0:58:12,300
不用难为情  成绩非常好
Don't be bashful. It's a wonderful report.

433
0:58:20,680 --> 0:58:24,640
她是唯一继承人 我也是
She's the sole heiress, and I'm the sole heir.

434
0:58:24,680 --> 0:58:26,640
好多年前就定下日子了
The date has been set for years.

435
0:58:26,680 --> 0:58:29,450
这是我从法国回来的另一个原因
That's another reason I came back from France.

436
0:58:33,950 --> 0:58:35,100
你爱她吗？
You love her?

437
0:58:35,350 --> 0:58:36,850
不爱
No.

438
0:58:37,850 --> 0:58:40,310
我不认识她
I don't know her.

439
0:58:40,350 --> 0:58:41,480
对我们来说 ...
For us ...

440
0:58:41,520 --> 0:58:44,190
婚姻都是家族包办的
marriages are arranged by the families.

441
0:58:44,230 --> 0:58:47,850
我们知道今后一起生活是无法想像的
We know that a future together is unthinkable ...

442
0:58:47,850 --> 0:58:51,520
所以我们以漫不经心的口吻谈论未来
so we speak of the future in a casual manner ...

443
0:58:49,770 --> 0:58:51,520



444
0:58:51,600 --> 0:58:54,850
不牵扯丝毫私人情感
without any involvement, detached.

445
0:58:54,860 --> 0:58:56,690
两个家族搞到一起 ...
And the two families got together ...

446
0:58:56,690 --> 0:58:59,190
把他们的财富藏起来
to hide their wealth away.

447
0:58:59,520 --> 0:59:02,770
这是中国重要的风俗 ...
It's so much the customs of ancient ...

448
0:59:02,810 --> 0:59:05,030
不管是古代还是现代中国
or modern China.

449
0:59:05,860 --> 0:59:09,360
我们没有任何其它选择
We don't think we could do anything any other way.

450
0:59:12,690 --> 0:59:14,150
他从来没有过工作
He's never had a job.

451
0:59:14,190 --> 0:59:16,650
他说如果他是穷人 ...
He says that if he was poor ...

452
0:59:16,690 --> 0:59:18,360
那就太可怕了
it would be terrible.

453
0:59:18,360 --> 0:59:20,440
他太懒了 不会去工作
He'd be much too lazy to work.

454
0:59:20,490 --> 0:59:23,490
是鸦片让人没有了力气
It's opium that takes away the strength.

455
0:59:23,530 --> 0:59:24,650
不
No.

456
0:59:24,690 --> 0:59:27,650
是他的财富让他没有了力气
It's wealth that takes his strength away.

457
0:59:27,700 --> 0:59:29,320
他什么都不做
He does nothing.

458
0:59:29,360 --> 0:59:30,490
什么都不做
Nothing.

459
0:59:30,530 --> 0:59:32,030
就知道爱
Only love.

460
0:59:33,860 --> 0:59:35,320
不过好笑的是
But it's funny ...

461
0:59:35,360 --> 0:59:38,030
我就因为这个才想要他
because that's the way I desire him.

462
0:59:48,830 --> 0:59:50,490
你还爱我吗？
Do you still love me?

463
1:00:38,090 --> 1:00:39,840
我们是情人
We are lovers.

464
1:00:39,880 --> 1:00:43,510
我们每天回到那个单身屋
Every day we go back to the bachelor's room.

465
1:00:43,550 --> 1:00:45,340
我们无法停止相爱
We can't stop loving.

466
1:00:46,470 --> 1:00:52,010
我们每天傍晚 都来堤岸的这个脏兮兮的街区幽会
This takes place in the sleazy district of Cholon every evening.

467
1:00:52,050 --> 1:00:53,630
每天傍晚 ...
Every evening ...

468
1:00:53,680 --> 1:00:56,630
这个少女来享受快乐 ...
the little one comes to receive the pleasure ...

469
1:00:56,680 --> 1:01:00,470
也让这个皮肤黝黑的男人叫出声来
that makes one scream from this dark man ...

470
1:01:00,510 --> 1:01:04,340
堤岸的这个中国男人 ...
this man from Cholon ... from China.

471
1:03:30,820 --> 1:03:34,770
沙 沥 小 学

472
1:04:00,930 --> 1:04:02,100
嘿 妈妈
Hi, Mom.

473
1:04:12,850 --> 1:04:14,020
嘿 保罗
Hi, Paul.

474
1:04:39,350 --> 1:04:43,470
我不时回到沙沥 ...
Now and then I go back to the house in Sa-Dec ...

475
1:04:43,500 --> 1:04:46,820
回到那个恐怖的家
to the horror of the house in Sa-Dec.

476
1:04:47,820 --> 1:04:49,270
那是一个无法忍受地方
It's an unbearable place.

477
1:04:49,320 --> 1:04:51,360
在死亡的阴影下 ...
It's close to death ...

478
1:04:51,400 --> 1:04:56,280
充满暴力 痛苦 绝望 和无耻
a place of violence, of pain, of despair, of dishonor.

479
1:04:57,860 --> 1:05:01,360
禁止你摔门！听见没有？
I forbid you to slam doors! Do you hear me?

480
1:05:02,970 --> 1:05:05,360
谁开车送你回来的？
Who drove you back from Saigon?

481
1:05:05,400 --> 1:05:07,780
我告诉过你  是个朋友  住永隆
I told you. A friend. He lives in Vinh Long.

482
1:05:07,860 --> 1:05:09,410
他正好顺路 所以主动提出送我
He offered to drop me off on his way through.

483
1:05:09,420 --> 1:05:10,750
是个朋友  不过如此！
He's a friend! That's all.

484
1:05:10,760 --> 1:05:12,450
谁住永隆啊？
Who in Vinh Long?

485
1:05:12,470 --> 1:05:14,530
你不认识
You wouldn't know him.

486
1:05:14,610 --> 1:05:16,740
他刚才巴黎回来
He just got back from Paris.

487
1:05:16,780 --> 1:05:18,640
是个朋友  有钱的朋友
A friend. A rich friend.

488
1:05:18,680 --> 1:05:21,410
不是每个人都有幸做穷人的
Not everybody's lucky enough to be poor.

489
1:05:21,950 --> 1:05:24,240
那么这个 ...
And this ...

490
1:05:24,280 --> 1:05:25,660
这是什么？
what's this?

491
1:05:25,700 --> 1:05:27,990
一张蓝纸
A piece of blue paper.

492
1:05:28,030 --> 1:05:30,120
是学生宿舍发的电报
It's a telegram from the boardinghouse.

493
1:05:30,160 --> 1:05:32,330
周二和周三你在什么地方过夜？
Where did you sleep Tuesday and Wednesday?

494
1:05:32,370 --> 1:05:33,870
周二和周三我在什么地方过夜？
Where did I sleep Tuesday and Wednesday?

495
1:05:33,950 --> 1:05:35,200
没在宿舍
Not at the boardinghouse.

496
1:05:35,240 --> 1:05:37,290
风扇坏了
The fans were out of order.

497
1:05:37,370 --> 1:05:39,290
我跟永隆的朋友睡觉了
I slept with my friend from Vinh Long.

498
1:05:39,370 --> 1:05:41,010
这就是你要我说的？
Is that what you want me to say?

499
1:05:41,040 --> 1:05:42,510
揍她  妈妈
Hit her, Mom.

500
1:05:42,580 --> 1:05:44,790
别让她躲过去
Don't let her get away with it.

501
1:05:44,800 --> 1:05:46,540
然而 正是这个家庭的冷漠 ...
But it's in this family's dryness ...

502
1:05:46,540 --> 1:05:49,000
和极度的严酷
in its incredible harshness ...

503
1:05:49,040 --> 1:05:55,520
让我深信不疑地确定 ...
that I am the most deeply assured of myself in the deepest of my essential certainties ...

504
1:05:55,560 --> 1:05:58,460
我们一家的毁灭和羞耻 ...
Our common history of ruin and shame ...

505
1:05:58,500 --> 1:06:01,670
爱与恨 根源正是我的肉身
of love and hate, is in my flesh.

506
1:06:02,830 --> 1:06:05,750
您的女儿像个婊子
Your daughter looks like a whore.

507
1:06:05,790 --> 1:06:07,710
嗨 你个傻瓜  别打了！
Hey, dummy, stop that shooting!

508
1:06:07,750 --> 1:06:10,210
我还待在这个家里
I am still in this family.

509
1:06:10,250 --> 1:06:13,630
也就是说 拒绝去所有其它住处
This is, barring all other places where I live.

510
1:06:13,660 --> 1:06:15,130
那是你的裙子 妈妈
That was your dress, Mom.

511
1:06:15,140 --> 1:06:17,550
鞋子也是你给我买的 我穿了几个月了
The shoes, you bought them for me. I've been wearing them for months.

512
1:06:17,580 --> 1:06:21,750
记得吗？大减价的时候
They were on sale, remember? Final reductions.

513
1:06:21,780 --> 1:06:24,250
你是故意这样
You do it on purpose.

514
1:06:24,280 --> 1:06:26,960
没看见我因为你落到什么地步了？
See what a state I'm in because of you?

515
1:06:27,010 --> 1:06:29,260
好象这能让你开心似的
It's as though it makes you happy.

516
1:06:33,210 --> 1:06:34,260
要是你不再信任我 ...
If you don't trust me anymore ...

517
1:06:34,300 --> 1:06:37,720
索性让我离开宿舍好了
just take me out of the boardinghouse.

518
1:06:39,720 --> 1:06:42,720
再说 并不是我自己要独自一个人 ...
Besides, I'm not the one who asked to be all alone ...

519
1:06:42,800 --> 1:06:45,230
整年待在西贡的
all year long in Saigon.

520
1:06:45,270 --> 1:06:48,260
母亲有时候会非常非常开心 ...
The mother can be very, very happy sometimes ...

521
1:06:48,300 --> 1:06:49,760
忘记一切烦恼
the time to forget.

522
1:06:49,800 --> 1:06:53,660
单是全家打扫卫生 就能让妈妈开心起来
That of washing the house may suffice for my mother's happiness.

523
1:06:53,700 --> 1:06:57,680
她弹钢琴 搞卫生 欢笑 ...
She plays the piano, she cleans, she laughs ...

524
1:06:57,720 --> 1:06:59,810
每个人都以为 ...
and everyone thinks ...

525
1:06:59,850 --> 1:07:05,020
这所破房子 突然变成沼泽 ...
that one can be happy in this gutted house that suddenly becomes a swamp ...

526
1:07:05,060 --> 1:07:06,770
变成河边的田地 变成渡口 沙滩
a field alongside a river ...

527
1:07:06,810 --> 1:07:09,730
就能让人开心起来
a ford, a beach.

528
1:08:39,410 --> 1:08:41,580
至为荣幸 夫人
My respects, madame.

529
1:08:41,620 --> 1:08:43,290
我母亲
My mother ...

530
1:08:44,620 --> 1:08:46,290
我哥哥皮埃尔
my brother Pierre ...

531
1:08:47,630 --> 1:08:49,920
我弟弟保罗
and my brother Paul.

532
1:08:56,960 --> 1:08:59,040
周六晚上 这里比较热闹
On Saturday night they are busy.

533
1:09:01,210 --> 1:09:03,380
来份鸡尾酒吗 先生？
Will you be having a cocktail, sir?

534
1:09:03,420 --> 1:09:06,420
是的  三杯马耳特-百悦  一瓶米酒
Yes. Three Martel-Perriers and a bottle of rice wine.

535
1:09:20,220 --> 1:09:22,670
孙中山建立共和国后 我们离开了中国 ...
We left China when Sun Yat-sen decreed the republic ...

536
1:09:22,720 --> 1:09:27,220
家父把他的地都卖给日本人 ...
and my father just sold all his lands to the Japanese ...

537
1:09:27,260 --> 1:09:29,220
后者已经占领了满洲里
who had already taken over Manchuria--

538
1:09:29,260 --> 1:09:31,970
还卖掉了所有房子 珠宝  都卖了 ...
all the houses, jewels, and everything ...

539
1:09:32,010 --> 1:09:35,510
然后去了南方
to go down towards the south.

540
1:09:36,800 --> 1:09:38,260
我母亲 ...
And my mother ...

541
1:09:38,300 --> 1:09:40,260
她病倒在路上 ...
she'd just lie in the road ...

542
1:09:40,300 --> 1:09:43,100
再也走不动了 ...
and she can't go on anymore ...

543
1:09:43,140 --> 1:09:46,260
母亲和两个兄弟一定什么都没有听见
The mother and the brothers mustn't know a thing.

544
1:09:46,310 --> 1:09:48,260
我们已经原则上说好：
It is set by principle ...

545
1:09:48,310 --> 1:09:49,760
他是跪着求我 ...
that he's at my feet ...

546
1:09:49,810 --> 1:09:52,260
我和他在一起是为了钱 ...
that I'm with him for the money ...

547
1:09:52,310 --> 1:09:54,270
我不能爱他
that I can't love him.

548
1:09:54,310 --> 1:09:57,020
因为他是中国人  因为他不是白人
This because he's Chinese, because he's not white.

549
1:09:57,060 --> 1:10:00,520
我的两个兄弟狼吞虎咽 根本不理睬他
My brothers devour and don't speak a word to him.

550
1:10:00,560 --> 1:10:03,890
我也不理他
I don't speak a word to him, either.

551
1:10:03,940 --> 1:10:07,390
在家人面前 他不再是我的情人
In my family's presence, he ceases to be my lover.

552
1:10:07,440 --> 1:10:08,890
他依旧存在 ...
He doesn't cease to exist ...

553
1:10:08,940 --> 1:10:10,890
但在我眼里已无足轻重
but he's nothing to me anymore.

554
1:10:10,940 --> 1:10:13,390
他成了没有地位的人 ...
He becomes a burned-out place ...

555
1:10:13,440 --> 1:10:14,900
成为无法接受的丑闻 ...
an unacceptable scandal ...

556
1:10:14,940 --> 1:10:19,560
成为羞耻的原因 必须予以隐藏
a reason to be ashamed of, that has to be hidden.

557
1:10:31,900 --> 1:10:35,020
那么 我们在等什么？
So, what are we waiting for?

558
1:10:36,080 --> 1:10:37,820
我希望去水帘舞厅喝一杯
I'd like to have a drink at La Cascade.

559
1:10:37,860 --> 1:10:39,530
您的账单 先生
Your bill, sir.

560
1:10:39,570 --> 1:10:42,610
我们希望去水帘舞厅喝酒和跳舞 ...
We'd like to go to La Cascade to drink and dance.

561
1:11:40,540 --> 1:11:42,000
你笑什么 ...
What makes you laugh ...

562
1:11:42,040 --> 1:11:44,500
因为我跟你妹妹跳舞？
that I'm dancing with your sister?

563
1:11:44,540 --> 1:11:45,500
不好意思
I'm sorry.

564
1:11:45,540 --> 1:11:47,000
你俩太不配了
You're so badly paired.

565
1:11:47,040 --> 1:11:48,500
别理他 先生
Don't pay attention, sir.

566
1:11:48,540 --> 1:11:50,500
他醉了 不过如此
He's drunk, that's all.

567
1:11:50,540 --> 1:11:51,500
什么？
What?

568
1:11:51,540 --> 1:11:53,590
我不能笑还是怎么着？
Can't I laugh or what?

569
1:11:55,960 --> 1:11:58,750
你想打架吗？
Do you want to fight?

570
1:11:58,800 --> 1:12:00,590
小心点儿 小朋友
Take care, little buddy.

571
1:12:01,430 --> 1:12:03,710
我让你这样的两个
It'd take two of you to do the job.

572
1:12:03,760 --> 1:12:05,300
不
Oh, no.

573
1:12:05,340 --> 1:12:07,920
远不止两个
A lot more than that.

574
1:12:07,970 --> 1:12:10,920
要四个我
Four of me, you mean.

575
1:12:10,970 --> 1:12:13,470
你想不出我多不禁打
You have no idea how weak I am.

576
1:13:02,900 --> 1:13:05,230
我们该走了
We should leave.

577
1:13:05,270 --> 1:13:07,310
原谅他 先生
Forgive him, sir.

578
1:13:07,350 --> 1:13:09,230
原谅我们
Forgive us.

579
1:13:09,270 --> 1:13:12,650
我教子无方
I've not brought my children up well.

580
1:13:12,990 --> 1:13:15,560
正在付出代价
I'm paying for it.

581
1:13:18,150 --> 1:13:21,360
我已经受到最大的惩罚
I'm the one who's punished the most.

582
1:16:01,770 --> 1:16:04,730
我们刚才做的值多少？
How much is what we did worth?

583
1:16:11,110 --> 1:16:13,730
在妓院里 你象刚才那样做 ...
In a brothel, how much does it cost ...

584
1:16:13,780 --> 1:16:16,730
要花多少钱？
to do what you just did to me?

585
1:16:18,780 --> 1:16:21,780
你需要多少？
How much do you need?

586
1:16:21,780 --> 1:16:24,440
我妈妈需要 500 比索
My mother needs 500 piasters.

587
1:17:01,950 --> 1:17:04,660
我拿到钱了
I've got your money.

588
1:17:04,700 --> 1:17:05,910
这里
Here.

589
1:17:07,790 --> 1:17:09,960
她办公室在哪儿？
Where's her office?

590
1:17:10,000 --> 1:17:11,500
就在那边
It's over there.

591
1:17:14,460 --> 1:17:18,230
您知道 我们需要让她晚上自由活动
You see, we have to let her go free in the evening ...

592
1:17:18,280 --> 1:17:21,380
不要规定她几点回宿舍
not tell her what time to be in.

593
1:17:21,430 --> 1:17:25,330
我们也千万不能强迫她和同学们一起去游玩
We mustn't force her to go on trips with the boarders, either.

594
1:17:25,360 --> 1:17:28,630
她一直是个不受拘束的孩子  要是不这样 她会出走的
She's always been a free child. Otherwise, she'd run away.

595
1:17:30,210 --> 1:17:33,630
就连我都不敢强迫她
Even I can't do a thing about that.

596
1:17:33,710 --> 1:17:37,530
即便没有人管束 她也一直用功学习
She's always worked very well in school even being so free.

597
1:17:39,280 --> 1:17:42,090
舍监同意了 因为我是白人 ...
The headmistress accepted because I'm white ...

598
1:17:42,130 --> 1:17:44,670
而且为了学生宿舍的声誉 ...
and that for the boardinghouse's reputation ...

599
1:17:44,710 --> 1:17:47,710
在所有这些混血的孩子中 必须有几个白人
amongst all the half-castes there must be a few whites.

600
1:17:47,760 --> 1:17:51,840
她允许我在宿舍象住旅店一样
She let me live in the boardinghouse as if it were a hotel.

601
1:17:53,220 --> 1:17:55,170
除了我的法文老师 ...
Other than my French teacher ...

602
1:17:55,220 --> 1:17:57,590
学校里没有人跟我讲话
nobody speaks to me at school.

603
1:17:57,590 --> 1:18:00,280
都是因为你
It's because of you.

604
1:18:00,720 --> 1:18:02,090
那是你的想象
That's your imagination.

605
1:18:02,180 --> 1:18:03,590
不
No.

606
1:18:03,590 --> 1:18:06,090
有些家长已经投诉了
There have been some complaints from families.

607
1:18:06,100 --> 1:18:08,100
他们说我是个荡妇 ...
They say I'm a slut ...

608
1:18:08,140 --> 1:18:10,590
到贫民区去 ...
and goes to the shady part of town ...

609
1:18:10,600 --> 1:18:13,100
让一个中国人摸她的身子
to have her body fondled by a Chinaman.

610
1:18:13,100 --> 1:18:14,220
没关系的
It's nothing.

611
1:18:18,100 --> 1:18:20,100
的确 是没关系
That's true. It's nothing.

612
1:18:36,560 --> 1:18:38,600
哎呀！球碰到她了  真恶心
Ooh! It touched her. It's nasty.

613
1:18:39,600 --> 1:18:42,940
哎呀！她和一个中国人睡觉
Ooh! She sleeps with a Chinaman.

614
1:19:10,610 --> 1:19:14,570
你早晚要回法国的
One day you're going to go back to France.

615
1:19:14,610 --> 1:19:16,280
我简直无法接受
I can't take that.

616
1:19:23,990 --> 1:19:26,820
你什么时候回法国？
When are you going back to France?

617
1:19:26,910 --> 1:19:29,160
毕业以后 ...
At the end of the school year ...

618
1:19:29,240 --> 1:19:30,610
但是还没有定
but it's not sure.

619
1:19:30,620 --> 1:19:33,320
妈妈还有很多麻烦 无法离开这里
My mother has a lot of difficulty in leaving here.

620
1:19:50,450 --> 1:19:52,910
这块宝石是我母亲的
The stone belonged to my mother.

621
1:19:52,950 --> 1:19:55,120
拿去吧
Take it.

622
1:21:28,660 --> 1:21:29,120
老爷

623
1:21:35,250 --> 1:21:35,640
阿爹

624
1:21:51,160 --> 1:21:52,840
我今天回来看你

625
1:21:54,840 --> 1:21:59,220
我想你已经知道 我结识了一个法国女子

626
1:22:02,250 --> 1:22:03,600
我承认

627
1:22:03,600 --> 1:22:05,560
我经常跟这个法国女子待在一起

628
1:22:06,620 --> 1:22:08,620
我真的不可以离开这个法国女子

629
1:22:10,800 --> 1:22:12,000
我真的很爱她

630
1:22:15,140 --> 1:22:15,700
一年啊

631
1:22:17,820 --> 1:22:20,560
请阿爹你 准许我们正式结婚

632
1:22:21,280 --> 1:22:21,930
一年啊

633
1:22:23,380 --> 1:22:26,260
一年之后我们再做打算

634
1:22:27,320 --> 1:22:28,020
好不好阿爹

635
1:22:31,020 --> 1:22:33,040
不可以答应你

636
1:22:34,740 --> 1:22:36,160
十年来

637
1:22:38,040 --> 1:22:43,180
我已经安排好你的婚事

638
1:22:44,540 --> 1:22:49,540
我同女方已经定好良辰吉日

639
1:22:50,060 --> 1:22:54,000
谁的话都不好使

640
1:22:55,600 --> 1:22:56,390
爹

641
1:22:57,380 --> 1:22:58,360
行了行了

642
1:23:01,290 --> 1:23:03,790
而且我跟他说我们的爱刚刚开始 ...
And I said to him that it's too new ...

643
1:23:03,830 --> 1:23:05,790
非常强烈 ...
it's too strong ...

644
1:23:06,530 --> 1:23:09,220
我还跟他说 ...
and I said to him that ...

645
1:23:09,260 --> 1:23:13,920
拆散我们是非常残酷的
it is horrid to take you away from my body.

646
1:23:13,960 --> 1:23:17,420
我跟他说 ...
I--I said to him that he--my father--

647
1:23:17,460 --> 1:23:21,420
他 － 我父亲 应该懂得这种爱 ...
he--he should know what it is ...

648
1:23:21,450 --> 1:23:25,630
这样强烈的爱 ...
a love like this-- so strong ...

649
1:23:25,670 --> 1:23:28,880
一人生中不会再有第二次
that it never happens again in a lifetime--

650
1:23:28,970 --> 1:23:30,130
永远不会
never.

651
1:23:39,970 --> 1:23:42,880
他要我跟这个年轻姑娘结婚 ...
He wants this marriage with ...

652
1:23:42,970 --> 1:23:45,470
我从来都没有见过她
this young girl I've never seen.

653
1:23:49,640 --> 1:23:53,390
他一点儿也不同情我
He shows no mercy for me.

654
1:23:53,470 --> 1:23:55,800
他不同情任何人
He shows none for anyone.

655
1:23:57,850 --> 1:23:59,310
那么你呢？
And you?

656
1:23:59,350 --> 1:24:01,470
你想不想和她结婚？
Do you want this marriage?

657
1:24:04,850 --> 1:24:08,980
问题不是我想不想
The question is not of wanting or not wanting.

658
1:24:21,150 --> 1:24:25,100
没有我父亲的财富 我什么都不是
I'm nothing without my father's wealth.

659
1:24:27,040 --> 1:24:29,150
他对我说 ...
He told me ...

660
1:24:31,360 --> 1:24:33,980
“我宁可看到你死 ...”
"I'd rather see you dead ...

661
1:24:33,980 --> 1:24:37,060
“也不想看到你跟那个白人姑娘在一起”
than know you were with that white girl."

662
1:24:37,150 --> 1:24:38,820
但是他说的对啊
But he's right.

663
1:24:38,860 --> 1:24:41,320
因为我早晚是要离去的 ...
He's right because anyhow I'll leave ...

664
1:24:41,360 --> 1:24:43,980
再说我也不爱你
and I have no love for you.

665
1:25:02,530 --> 1:25:03,860
你看
You see.

666
1:25:03,950 --> 1:25:05,160
就是这里
It's here.

667
1:25:06,610 --> 1:25:09,320
我小时候 ...
My mother, when I was little ...

668
1:25:09,320 --> 1:25:14,320
妈妈想在这里建一个水坝 来保护她的良田
wanted to erect a dam to protect her good-growing land.

669
1:25:14,520 --> 1:25:16,990
为了我们 她想变得富有
She wanted to become rich for us.

670
1:25:19,660 --> 1:25:22,930
她把父亲死后留下的全部积蓄都投了进去
She put all the savings left after my father's death into it.

671
1:25:26,330 --> 1:25:28,830
她被人骗了
People lied to her.

672
1:25:29,480 --> 1:25:32,030
地被淹后  土地管理局的代理卖了地 ...
The land registrar agents sold her flood lands ...

673
1:25:32,080 --> 1:25:34,330
好从中提成
just to earn their premiums.

674
1:25:34,330 --> 1:25:36,830
海水把什么都淹了
Saltwater covered everything.

675
1:25:36,830 --> 1:25:40,000
她丧失了这里的一切 － 所有的东西
She lost everything here--everything.

676
1:25:40,800 --> 1:25:45,230
她用了好几年的时间 才相信人们会偷走她的全部积蓄 ...
It took her years to believe that it was possible for people to steal all her savings ...

677
1:25:45,260 --> 1:25:48,330
然后再也不承认她 还把她赶出去
and then never acknowledge her again, to throw her out.

678
1:25:49,930 --> 1:25:52,330
她一次次发作
She would scream. She had fits.

679
1:25:52,330 --> 1:25:54,000
人们开始说她疯了 ...
People started to say that she was crazy ...

680
1:25:54,040 --> 1:25:56,710
再也不相信她说的 关于她的钱的事情 ...
to not believe what she said about her money anymore ...

681
1:25:56,750 --> 1:25:59,250
人们说她撒谎
to say that she was lying.

682
1:26:01,670 --> 1:26:05,210
我们好多年没有和白人来往
We never saw another white person for years.

683
1:26:05,300 --> 1:26:07,710
白种人都以我们为耻
The whites were ashamed of us.

684
1:26:09,000 --> 1:26:11,100
她不得不放弃一切
She had to give everything up.

685
1:26:11,220 --> 1:26:13,710
她把高处的稻田送给了佣人
The upper rice paddy -- she gave it to the servants ...

686
1:26:14,300 --> 1:26:17,880
还有房子和所有的家具
along with the bungalow and all the furniture.

687
1:26:23,800 --> 1:26:25,220
我们常常坐在这里 ...
We used to sit here ...

688
1:26:25,300 --> 1:26:27,920
我和妈妈还有弟弟 ...
with my mother and my little brother ...

689
1:26:28,000 --> 1:26:32,830
望着山那边 泰国的天空
and we'd watch the sky of Siam over there behind the mountains.

690
1:26:44,760 --> 1:26:46,930
你冷吗？
You feel cold?

691
1:26:47,010 --> 1:26:48,430
有一点儿
A little.

692
1:27:20,020 --> 1:27:22,190
就在那个傍晚 我知道了我要做的事情
That evening I know it.

693
1:27:22,190 --> 1:27:25,190
而且是我唯一要做的事情
I know only that ...

694
1:27:25,190 --> 1:27:29,650
以后我要写妈妈的生活
later I will write my mother's life--

695
1:27:29,690 --> 1:27:34,250
写土地管理局的代理如何毁了她 ...
how she was killed by the land registrar agents ...

696
1:27:34,290 --> 1:27:37,190
政府官员如何趁火打劫
robbed by the government officials.

697
1:27:39,070 --> 1:27:41,150
我要写作 －
To write--

698
1:27:41,190 --> 1:27:44,190
那是我所看到的未来 ...
that's what I see beyond the moment ...

699
1:27:44,490 --> 1:27:45,890
在那片荒地上 ...
in that great desert ...

700
1:27:46,210 --> 1:27:47,990
在落日的余晖中 ...
under the features of which ...

701
1:27:48,100 --> 1:27:51,020
我看到了我未来的人生
I see the extent of my life.

702
1:28:10,530 --> 1:28:12,660
她美吗？
Is she beautiful?

703
1:28:12,660 --> 1:28:13,830
她很有钱
She's rich.

704
1:28:17,870 --> 1:28:21,160
家里选择她 也是因为她有钱
The family chose her also because of that.

705
1:28:23,160 --> 1:28:26,240
她的衣服上有金子 ...
She's covered with gold ...

706
1:28:26,330 --> 1:28:28,160
翡翠 ...
jade ...

707
1:28:28,160 --> 1:28:30,160
还有钻石
and diamonds.

708
1:28:35,670 --> 1:28:39,210
在我之前 你和白人姑娘睡过吗？
Did you ever sleep with a white girl before me?

709
1:28:44,710 --> 1:28:46,960
在巴黎 当然
In Paris, of course.

710
1:28:49,170 --> 1:28:52,130
在这里 没有
Here, no.

711
1:28:52,170 --> 1:28:53,540
为什么？
Why?

712
1:28:56,170 --> 1:28:58,300
在这里 ...
Here ...

713
1:28:58,340 --> 1:29:01,050
除了法国妓女 ...
other than French prostitutes ...

714
1:29:01,090 --> 1:29:04,050
不可能和白种女人来往
it's impossible to have white women.

715
1:29:06,090 --> 1:29:08,260
完全不可能
Totally impossible.

716
1:29:40,600 --> 1:29:43,890
我要你亲口对我说一遍
I want you to say it to me once.

717
1:29:46,850 --> 1:29:51,270
你来是为了得到我的钱
You came here so that I'd give you money.

718
1:29:53,100 --> 1:29:56,600
我来是为了得到你的钱
I came here so that you'd give me money.

719
1:30:02,230 --> 1:30:04,100
跟着我说
Repeat after me.

720
1:30:06,600 --> 1:30:09,560
从我在渡船上看到你那一刻起 ...
I was thinking about money ...

721
1:30:09,610 --> 1:30:12,400
我想的就是钱 ...
and only about money ...

722
1:30:12,440 --> 1:30:16,070
仅仅是钱
from the moment I saw you on the ferry.

723
1:30:16,110 --> 1:30:18,070
从我在渡船上看到你那一刻起 ...
I was thinking about money ...

724
1:30:18,110 --> 1:30:19,570
我想的就是钱 ...
and only about money ...

725
1:30:19,610 --> 1:30:23,110
仅仅是钱
since the moment I saw you on the ferry.

726
1:30:27,110 --> 1:30:29,030
你是个婊子
You're a whore.

727
1:30:30,280 --> 1:30:32,190
你是个婊子
You're a whore.

728
1:30:36,570 --> 1:30:39,440
我没有感觉恶心
I don't find that disgusting.

729
1:30:39,530 --> 1:30:41,700
正相反 ...
On the contrary ...

730
1:31:04,580 --> 1:31:06,030
你知道 ...
You know ...

731
1:31:09,080 --> 1:31:10,740
在你之前 ...
before you ...

732
1:31:12,330 --> 1:31:14,950
我完全不知道什么是痛苦
I knew nothing about suffering.

733
1:31:19,580 --> 1:31:21,370
我非常想 ...
I would love to ...

734
1:31:23,580 --> 1:31:27,040
我非常想带你走 ...
I would love to take you ...

735
1:31:27,080 --> 1:31:29,540
但是我没有力量
but I'm without strength.

736
1:31:35,040 --> 1:31:37,750
我完全没有任何力量
I'm without any strength at all.

737
1:31:42,960 --> 1:31:44,460
我死了
I'm dead.

738
1:31:48,090 --> 1:31:50,550
我对你没有欲望
I have no desire for you.

739
1:32:00,720 --> 1:32:03,920
我的身体不再想要不爱自己的人
My body no longer wants the one who doesn't love.

740
1:33:17,030 --> 1:33:19,570
你知道这值多少钱吗？
Do you know what that's worth?

741
1:33:19,610 --> 1:33:21,490
你要我们相信 ...
You want to have us believe ...

742
1:33:21,530 --> 1:33:24,030
他给你这个 仅仅是为了你的漂亮脸蛋？
he just gave it to you for your pretty face?

743
1:33:27,400 --> 1:33:29,240
他为什么给你这么大的钻石？
Why did he give you such a diamond?

744
1:33:29,280 --> 1:33:31,990
为什么？因为他很有钱
Why? Because he's rich.

745
1:33:32,030 --> 1:33:34,320
你的女儿在卖身
Your daughter's whoring.

746
1:33:38,280 --> 1:33:39,740
拿去好了！卖了它！
Take it! Sell it!

747
1:33:39,780 --> 1:33:41,740
看我在乎不在乎这个戒指！
See if I care about that ring!

748
1:33:41,780 --> 1:33:43,740
你和他睡了  我敢肯定
You slept with him. I'm sure of it.

749
1:33:43,780 --> 1:33:44,990
一看就知道
Just take a look at her.

750
1:33:45,030 --> 1:33:46,570
她太不知羞耻了
She's a disgrace.

751
1:33:46,620 --> 1:33:47,580
什么
What?

752
1:33:47,620 --> 1:33:49,080
你一定要收拾她  妈
You've got to do something, Mum.

753
1:33:49,120 --> 1:33:52,490
你们说什么哪？我 和一个中国人？
What are you saying? Me with a Chinaman?

754
1:33:52,530 --> 1:33:54,490
什么都没有发生 － 什么都没有 ...
Nothing happened-- nothing--

755
1:33:54,530 --> 1:33:56,240
连接吻都没有
not even a kiss.

756
1:34:02,870 --> 1:34:05,620
有中国人的气味
It smells of Chinese.

757
1:34:08,460 --> 1:34:10,460
他跟你睡了
He slept with you.

758
1:34:12,620 --> 1:34:13,960
承认吧
Say it.

759
1:34:16,670 --> 1:34:18,120
承认吧
Say it.

760
1:34:18,120 --> 1:34:19,960
给我承认！
Say it!

761
1:34:19,960 --> 1:34:22,210
你必须承认 你个婊子
You're going to say it, you bitch!

762
1:34:22,250 --> 1:34:23,750
你个肮脏的婊子
You filthy bitch!

763
1:34:23,790 --> 1:34:26,920
你跟中国佬睡觉  你很喜欢对不对？
You slept with a Chink. Did you like it? Huh?

764
1:34:26,960 --> 1:34:28,920
皮埃尔 住手！
Pierre, stop!

765
1:34:28,960 --> 1:34:32,590
住手 给我住手！你快弄死她了！
Stop it, I say! Stop it! You're going to kill her!

766
1:34:32,630 --> 1:34:35,380
住手！住手 看上帝份上！
Stop it! Stop it, for god's sake!

767
1:34:35,420 --> 1:34:36,880
你快弄死她了 皮埃尔！
You're killing her, Pierre!

768
1:34:36,920 --> 1:34:38,170
住手！
Stop it!

769
1:36:59,210 --> 1:37:02,710
我还以为我的孩子不会来了
I thought my child wouldn't come anymore.

770
1:37:02,710 --> 1:37:04,790
我叫了一辆人力车
I took a rickshaw.

771
1:37:08,830 --> 1:37:10,500
你吸了很多吗？
Did you smoke a lot?

772
1:37:12,210 --> 1:37:13,710
这是我唯一的事情
That's all I do.

773
1:37:16,000 --> 1:37:17,960
我没有了欲望
I have no desire left.

774
1:37:19,210 --> 1:37:21,210
我没有了爱
I have no love left.

775
1:37:23,210 --> 1:37:24,880
真太奇妙了
It's wonderful.

776
1:37:24,880 --> 1:37:29,210
就好象我们从来没有见过 ...
It's as though we'd never met ...

777
1:37:29,250 --> 1:37:33,010
或者你离去了好几个月
or as though you left months ago.

778
1:37:49,260 --> 1:37:51,300
你什么时候结婚？
When are you getting married?

779
1:37:55,930 --> 1:37:58,090
下周五
Next Friday ...

780
1:37:58,140 --> 1:38:00,890
然后离开这里 ...
and leaving ...

781
1:38:00,970 --> 1:38:04,970
乘亚历山杜马号轮船
on the Alexandre Dumas the 12th.

782
1:38:07,640 --> 1:38:09,810
看着我
Look at me.

783
1:38:09,850 --> 1:38:15,310
我早晚会因为爱你而死
I'm going to die of love for you.

784
1:38:20,210 --> 1:38:21,850
你结婚后 ...
After your marriage ...

785
1:38:21,890 --> 1:38:23,850
我们在这里见面 ...
we'll meet here one time--

786
1:38:23,890 --> 1:38:24,850
就一次
just once.

787
1:38:25,190 --> 1:38:27,190
记住了吗？
You remember?

788
1:38:27,190 --> 1:38:28,890
你答应我
You promise d me.

789
1:40:47,380 --> 1:40:51,050
那个红木桌也要卖吗？
You're also selling the rosewood table?

790
1:40:51,050 --> 1:40:52,720
是的
Yes.

791
1:40:52,800 --> 1:40:55,220
所有的东西都留下
I'm leaving everything.

792
1:40:55,310 --> 1:40:57,810
这里的一切都结束了
It's all finished here.

793
1:41:03,520 --> 1:41:07,350
我唯一舍不得的 是哪些铁床
The only thing I'll miss are the metal beds.

794
1:41:07,390 --> 1:41:10,430
法国的床太软
In France, the beds are too soft.

795
1:41:15,560 --> 1:41:17,720
那帽子怎么回事？
What's that hat?

796
1:41:18,210 --> 1:41:21,460
妈妈 我戴了好几个月了
Mom, I've been wearing it for months.

797
1:41:23,260 --> 1:41:25,230
是我给你买的吗？
-Did I buy that for you?

798
1:41:25,240 --> 1:41:26,230
还能有谁？
Who else?

799
1:41:26,570 --> 1:41:29,230
总有一天 我们可以让你买我们喜欢的任何东西
Some days we can make you buy anything we want.

800
1:41:29,230 --> 1:41:31,230
我都忘了
I forgot.

801
1:41:35,560 --> 1:41:37,560
你知道 ...
You know ...

802
1:41:37,570 --> 1:41:39,560
我和你不一样
I wasn't like you.

803
1:41:42,360 --> 1:41:46,230
我学东西没有你那么容易 ...
I didn't study as easily as you do ...

804
1:41:46,230 --> 1:41:48,400
而且我 ...
and l ...

805
1:41:53,070 --> 1:41:55,360
我非常认真 ...
I was very serious ...

806
1:41:57,650 --> 1:42:00,860
认真了这么久 － 太久了
for so long--too long.

807
1:42:04,570 --> 1:42:08,530
所以我已经感觉不到自己的快乐
That's how I lost the feeling of my own pleasure.

808
1:42:13,040 --> 1:42:15,530
他的确做了一件好事 真的
He did a really good thing, truly.

809
1:42:15,570 --> 1:42:18,030
谁做了一件好事？
Who did a good thing?

810
1:42:18,070 --> 1:42:19,570
你的朋友 －
Your friend--

811
1:42:19,620 --> 1:42:21,780
你的中国朋友
your Chinese friend.

812
1:42:21,870 --> 1:42:24,480
他替你哥还清了烟馆的债
He paid off your brother's debts at the opium den.

813
1:42:25,980 --> 1:42:28,040
还付了路费
He also paid for the trip.

814
1:42:28,080 --> 1:42:29,740
他真了不起 －
He was wonderful--

815
1:42:29,790 --> 1:42:31,910
也非常谨慎
very discreet, too.

816
1:42:31,950 --> 1:42:34,540
我过去低估了他
I had underestimated him.

817
1:42:34,580 --> 1:42:37,080
我很抱歉
I'm sorry about that.

818
1:42:41,580 --> 1:42:44,540
你是单纯为钱 才和他在一起吗？
Do you only see him for the money?

819
1:42:47,580 --> 1:42:49,040
是的
Yes.

820
1:46:54,370 --> 1:46:57,570
当第一遍发船汽笛声响起
It was when the boat uttered its first farewell ...

821
1:46:57,800 --> 1:47:00,830
舷梯吊起来 ...
and the gangway had been hauled up ...

822
1:47:00,850 --> 1:47:04,100
拖船开始出发 ...
and the tugs had started to tow it ...

823
1:47:04,210 --> 1:47:05,970
将轮船拖离码头的时候 ...
to draw it away from the land ...

824
1:47:06,000 --> 1:47:08,770
她哭了
that she had wept.

825
1:47:10,270 --> 1:47:13,270
她强忍住泪水
She'd done it without showing her tears ...

826
1:47:13,270 --> 1:47:18,020
不让妈妈和弟弟看见她的悲伤 ...
without showing her mother or her little brother that she was sad ...

827
1:47:18,040 --> 1:47:20,270
什么都不流露出来 ...
without showing anything ...

828
1:47:20,270 --> 1:47:23,250
就象家里的惯例一样
as was the custom between them.

829
1:48:12,620 --> 1:48:15,560
他在那儿
He was there.

830
1:48:15,580 --> 1:48:18,620
那是他  在远处 －
That was him in the back--

831
1:48:18,660 --> 1:48:21,660
几乎看不见 ...
that scarcely visible shape ...

832
1:48:21,750 --> 1:48:26,370
他一动不动  身心崩溃
that made no movement, crushed.

833
1:48:32,580 --> 1:48:34,760
她俯在栏杆上 ...
She was leaning on the railing ...

834
1:48:34,770 --> 1:48:37,270
象渡船初见那天一样
like the first time on the ferry.

835
1:48:37,860 --> 1:48:40,170
她知道他在望着她
She knew he was watching her.

836
1:48:40,210 --> 1:48:42,630
她也望着他
She was watching him, too.

837
1:49:04,430 --> 1:49:06,550
她已经看不到他了
She couldn't see him anymore, but she still looked ...

838
1:49:06,560 --> 1:49:10,760
但是仍然朝那辆黑色的轿车望去
towards the shape of the black car.

839
1:49:20,300 --> 1:49:23,560
直到它消失在视野中
In the end, she didn't see it anymore.

840
1:49:23,600 --> 1:49:26,140
码头也渐渐消失 ...
The harbor had faded away ...

841
1:49:26,140 --> 1:49:28,140
接着是陆地
and then the land.

842
1:49:45,910 --> 1:49:49,910
一天夜里 轮船穿越印度洋时
One night, during the crossing of the Indian Ocean ...

843
1:49:49,930 --> 1:49:57,640
甲板上突然响起肖邦的圆舞曲
in the main room on the big deck there had been a sudden burst of a waltz by Chopin.

844
1:50:02,150 --> 1:50:04,150
海上寂静无风 ...
There wasn't a breath of wind ...

845
1:50:04,150 --> 1:50:05,770
于是在那个夜晚 ...
and that night ...

846
1:50:05,810 --> 1:50:08,750
音乐回荡整个邮轮 ...
the music had spread all over the black liner ...

847
1:50:08,790 --> 1:50:10,650
犹如天籁 ...
Like an injunction from heaven ...

848
1:50:10,690 --> 1:50:13,150
关乎未知 ...
related to something unknown ...

849
1:50:13,150 --> 1:50:15,150
象是上帝的指令 ...
Like an order from God ...

850
1:50:15,150 --> 1:50:17,650
其含义深奥莫测 ...
whose meaning was inscrutable.

851
1:50:39,820 --> 1:50:41,320
她哭了 ...
She had wept ...

852
1:50:41,320 --> 1:50:44,900
因为她想到堤岸的那个男人
because she had thought of that man from Cholon--

853
1:50:44,910 --> 1:50:46,620
她的情人 －
her lover--

854
1:50:46,660 --> 1:50:50,120
突然之间 她不再确定自己是不是从未爱过他 ...
and suddenly she wasn't sure of not having loved him ...

855
1:50:50,160 --> 1:50:52,160
还是由于那是一种她从未见过的爱 ...
with a love she hadn't seen ...

856
1:50:52,160 --> 1:50:54,780
消散在这个故事当中 ...
because it had lost itself in the story ...

857
1:50:54,830 --> 1:50:56,780
如水入沙 ...
Like water in the sand ...

858
1:50:56,830 --> 1:50:59,780
而现在 ... 在荡漾于海上的乐声中
and that she was rediscovering it now ...

859
1:50:59,830 --> 1:51:04,290
她重新找到了这种爱
in this moment of music flung across the sea.

860
1:51:27,490 --> 1:51:28,770
二战后 ...
Years after the war ...

861
1:51:28,800 --> 1:51:31,500
在我成婚 养儿育女 ...
after the marriages, the children ...

862
1:51:31,510 --> 1:51:33,710
然后又离婚 出书后 ...
the divorces, the books ...

863
1:51:33,720 --> 1:51:36,610
他和妻子来到巴黎
he had come to Paris with his wife.

864
1:51:36,620 --> 1:51:38,790
他打电话给她
He had phoned her.

865
1:51:40,780 --> 1:51:42,560
他非常胆怯
He was intimidated.

866
1:51:42,570 --> 1:51:44,630
声音颤抖 ...
His voice trembled ...

867
1:51:44,670 --> 1:51:49,210
他的中国口音也在颤抖中再次出现
and with the trembling, it had found the accent of China again.

868
1:51:49,240 --> 1:51:51,990
他知道她开始写书
He knew she'd begun writing books.

869
1:51:52,000 --> 1:51:55,010
也得知她弟弟的死讯
He had also heard about the younger brother's death.

870
1:51:55,020 --> 1:51:57,200
他为她难过 ...
He had been sad for her ...

871
1:51:57,580 --> 1:52:01,210
接着 他不知道对她说什么好了 ...
and then he hadn't known what to tell her ...

872
1:52:01,740 --> 1:52:03,910
然后 他对她说了
and then he'd told her--

873
1:52:03,920 --> 1:52:06,900
以前也对她说过的话 －
he had told her that it was as before ...

874
1:52:06,920 --> 1:52:08,910
他依然爱她 ...
that he still loved her ...

875
1:52:08,990 --> 1:52:11,910
而且永远爱她 ...
that he would never stop loving her ...

876
1:52:12,090 --> 1:52:15,550
至死不渝
that he would love her until his death.

877
1:52:25,390 --> 1:52:31,850
