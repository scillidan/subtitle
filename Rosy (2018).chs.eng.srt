0:39:42,170 --> 0:39:44,570
她本来可以活下来的
She could have survived,

495
0:39:44,580 --> 0:39:47,610
我让他们把她从生命维持器上取下来
and I told them to take her off life support.

496
0:39:48,550 --> 0:39:50,350
你为什么要这样做
Why did you do that?

497
0:39:50,350 --> 0:39:52,780
如果由我决定 我当然会让她活着
If it were up to me, I would have kept her alive, of course.course.

498
0:39:52,780 --> 0:39:55,150
但她不会想这样回来的 我了解她
But she wouldn't want to come back like that. I know her.her.

499
0:39:58,260 --> 0:39:59,560

我也知道孤独的感觉
I do know what it's like to feel alone.

我以前从来没有这样做过
I've never done this before.

我今天有一个试演
I had an audition today.

513
0:41:02,960 --> 0:41:04,930
我想我让自己出丑了
I think I made a fool of myself.

514
0:41:06,490 --> 0:41:07,960
表演课不是很有帮助吗
Aren't acting classes helping?

515
0:41:09,130 --> 0:41:10,230
嗯
Mm.

516
0:41:11,700 --> 0:41:13,740
它让你对学校感到内疚
It makes you feel guilty about school.

517

为什么
Why?

518
0:41:19,170 --> 0:41:20,310
我不知道 我只是
I don't know, I just...

519
0:41:21,810 --> 0:41:24,110
我只是不知道我是否足够想要它
I just don't know if I want it badly enough.

520
0:41:24,110 --> 0:41:25,950
就像 有什么意义
Like, what's the point

521
0:41:25,950 --> 0:41:28,980
在学费上欠下这么多债
of racking up all this debt in tuition?

522
0:41:29,890 --> 0:41:31,620
你知道 它会变得更好
You know, it's gonna get better.

523
0:41:33,350 --> 0:41:34,320
嗯 我
Well, I...

524
0:41:36,160 --> 0:41:38,030
有什么意义呢
What's the point?

525
0:41:44,300 --> 0:41:45,300
你说完了吗
You done?

526
0:41:45,300 --> 0:41:46,370
- 嗯 嗯 - 好啊
- Mm-hmm. - Okay.

527
0:41:58,920 --> 0:42:00,980
你知道 亲爱的 你所做的只是抱怨
You know, honey, all you ever do is whine

528
0:42:00,980 --> 0:42:03,880
并为在这个行业的发展感到焦虑
and have anxiety over making it in the business.

529
0:42:03,890 --> 0:42:05,960
这99%是你无法控制的
It's 99% out of your control.

530
0:42:06,820 --> 0:42:08,160
这不是我所做的
That's not what I do.

531
0:42:12,600 --> 0:42:14,160
你读了我给你的那本书吗
Did you read that book I gave you?

532
0:42:15,600 --> 0:42:16,830
还没有
Not yet.

533
0:42:18,600 --> 0:42:19,970
我可以问你一些问题吗
Can I ask you something?

534
0:42:22,310 --> 0:42:23,210
可以

我在很多关系中都说过 我爱你
I've said "I love you" in plenty of relationships.

539
0:42:45,630 --> 0:42:47,230
我的问题是 呃
My problem is, uh...

540
0:42:49,870 --> 0:42:51,400
我们最终会厌烦别人
we eventually get sick of people.

541
0:42:53,240 --> 0:42:55,310
这真是个愤世嫉俗的说法
That's a really cynical thing to say.

542
0:42:59,640 --> 0:43:01,180
你为什么不厌烦我
Why don't you get sick of me?

543
0:43:38,690 --> 0:43:40,050

That's fine.

589
0:48:07,770 --> 0:48:11,740
哦 我只是掩盖了这一点 所以 我看起来的方式是一个惊喜
Oh, I only covered that so that the way that I looked is a surprise.looked is a surprise.

590
0:48:13,240 --> 0:48:15,110
我想 别担心
I figured. Don't worry about it.

591
0:48:17,010 --> 0:48:18,480
我知道你为什么这么做
I knew why you did it.

592
0:48:21,310 --> 0:48:24,520
那么 你要带我去哪里
So... where are you taking me?

593
0:48:25,550 --> 0:48:28,120
呃 去饭厅
Uh, to the dining room.

594
0:48:28,120 --> 0:48:29,920
啊 太棒了
Ah! Fantastic.

595
0:48:29,920 --> 0:48:31,920
从未去过
Never been.

596
0:48:48,210 --> 0:48:50,440
我有时确实想念肉
I do miss meat sometimes.

597
0:48:50,440 --> 0:48:52,750
你想吃一口吗这里的肉很不错
Do you want a bite? The cut here is fantastic.

598
0:48:55,480 --> 0:48:57,550
好吧 我试试
Okay. I'll try it.

599
0:48:57,550 --> 0:48:58,720
但不要告诉任何人
But don't tell anyone.

600
0:49:09,630 --> 0:49:11,100
嗯
Mmm.

601
0:49:11,830 --> 0:49:13,130
这很好
It's good.

602
0:49:15,540 --> 0:49:17,030
我只是
I just...

603
0:49:17,040 --> 0:49:19,270
我只是太喜欢动物了
I just love animals too much.

604
0:49:19,270 --> 0:49:21,980
那么你绝对应该成为吃肉的支持者
Then you should definitely be a proponent of meat eating,eating,

605
0:49:21,980 --> 0:49:23,210
因为一旦我们毁了我们的星球
because once we ruin our planet,

606
0:49:23,210 --> 0:49:24,910
我们将不得不搬到另一个星球
we'll have to move to another one.

607
0:49:24,910 --> 0:49:27,980
而唯一能说服人们为动物腾出空间的东西
And the only thing that'll convince people to make room for the animalsroom for the animals

608
0:49:27,980 --> 0:49:29,550
就是他们有机会吃它们
is their chance to eat them.

609
0:49:33,420 --> 0:49:35,160
那么你的父母住在哪里
So where do your parents live?

610
0:49:37,660 --> 0:49:40,460
我父亲从小就不在身边 我母亲
My father was never around growing up, and my mother...mother...

611
0:49:40,930 --> 0:49:42,200
自杀了
killed herself.

612
0:49:42,660 --> 0:49:43,730
为什么
Why?

613
0:49:44,570 --> 0:49:46,370
我不知道 我当时非常年轻
I don't know. I was very young.

614
0:49:47,240 --> 0:49:48,340
我想我是幸运的
I think I'm lucky.

615
0:49:48,340 --> 0:49:49,940
否则可能会非常痛苦
It might have been very painful otherwise.

616
0:49:49,940 --> 0:49:51,510
嗯
Hmm.

617
0:49:51,510 --> 0:49:54,240
我的父母可能甚至不知道我失踪了
My parents probably don't even know that I'm missing.

618
0:49:54,240 --> 0:49:55,650
我怀疑这一点
I doubt that.

619
0:49:57,580 --> 0:49:59,310
我是说 他们有一些钱
I mean, they have some money.

620
0:49:59,320 --> 0:50:00,710
他们并不富裕或什么的
They're not filthy rich or anything,

621
0:50:00,720 --> 0:50:04,190
但他们可以把我送到学校
but they could have put me through school.

622
0:50:04,190 --> 0:50:07,360
我只是 我只是不认为他们很喜欢我
I just... I just don't think they like me very much.

623
0:50:08,120 --> 0:50:09,520
说得好听一点
And to put it kindly,

624
0:50:09,530 --> 0:50:11,930
我妈妈很单纯 我爸爸是个自恋狂
my mom is simple, my father's a narcissist,

625
0:50:11,930 --> 0:50:14,630
所以我不得不自己做一切事情
so I've had to do everything myself.

626
0:50:14,630 --> 0:50:16,500
我觉得这很累人
And I find it pretty exhausting.

627
0:50:25,010 --> 0:50:27,350
那么 你认为警察在找我吗
So, you think the police are looking for me?

628
0:50:31,720 --> 0:50:32,920
你希望他们是吗
Do you want them to be?

629
0:50:42,090 --> 0:50:43,460
你是一个相当好的厨师
You're a pretty good cook.

630
0:50:45,960 --> 0:50:47,930
你是你餐厅的主厨吗
Are you the chef at your restaurant?

631
0:50:47,930 --> 0:50:51,030
嗯 我算是一个万能的人 我是个副厨师
Um, I'm sort of an everything man. I'm a sous-chef,

632
0:50:51,040 --> 0:50:52,800
我是副主厨 我帮助服务
and I help serve.

633
0:50:52,800 --> 0:50:56,410
但我的经理说 他将及时把我调到厨房
But my manager said that he'll move me into the kitchen in time.kitchen in time.

634
0:50:57,810 --> 0:50:59,680
你是做什么的
What do you do?

635
0:51:01,810 --> 0:51:04,380
哦 我是个演员
Oh... I'm an actress.

636
0:51:06,720 --> 0:51:08,920
- 一个女演员
- An actress? - Mm-hmm.

637
0:51:08,920 --> 0:51:11,660
我可以看到 你会是一个非常棒的女演员
I can see that. You'd be a really fantastic actress.

638
0:51:11,660 --> 0:51:14,190
我很想在电影屏幕上看到你的脸
I'd love to see your face on a movie screen.

639
0:51:16,430 --> 0:51:17,330
哇
Wow.

640
0:51:19,230 --> 0:51:20,800
我的意思是
I mean...

641
0:51:20,800 --> 0:51:23,270
你为什么不开你自己的餐馆
Why don't you open your own restaurant?

642
0:51:23,270 --> 0:51:26,410
你是个很好的厨师 不能只为人们服务
You're too good of a cook to just be serving people.

643
0:51:27,770 --> 0:51:29,980
我刚刚吃了一块牛排 看在上帝的份上
I've just had a piece of steak, for Christ sake.

644
0:51:30,810 --> 0:51:32,180
这不是那么简单
It's not that simple.

645
0:51:32,180 --> 0:51:36,050
嗯 偷一个人并不简单
Mm... Stealing a person is not simple,

646
0:51:36,050 --> 0:51:38,220
但你已经做到了
yet you've done that.

647
0:51:38,220 --> 0:51:40,220
你只需要足够渴望它
You just have to want it badly enough.

648
0:51:40,620 --> 0:51:42,220
恐惧是愚蠢的
Fear is stupid.

649
0:51:42,220 --> 0:51:44,890
大多数遗憾也是如此
And so are most regrets.

650
0:51:48,800 --> 0:51:50,630
你知道吗 一开始我很害怕带走你
You know, I was scared to take you at first,

651
0:51:50,630 --> 0:51:53,470
但后来我想 如果它是注定的 它将是
but then I thought, if it's meant to be, it'll be.

652
0:51:56,570 --> 0:51:58,010
好吧 你从来没有告诉过我我很漂亮
Well, you never tell me I'm pretty.

653
0:51:59,510 --> 0:52:02,840
- 呃 我觉得你是
- Uh, I think you're... - No, don't. Don't.

654
0:52:04,810 --> 0:52:08,110
因为如果你现在说 就意味着你不是真心的
Because if you say it now, it means that you don't mean it.mean it.

655
