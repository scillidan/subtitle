1
0:00:51,400 --> 0:00:53,120
Monkey King, you bastard

2
0:00:53,360 --> 0:00:54,660
You've promised Buddha

3
0:00:54,860 --> 0:00:56,990
To help the Longevity Monk to get scriptures in the west

4
0:00:57,260 --> 0:00:59,590
But the King Bull and you decided to eat your master

5
0:00:59,830 --> 0:01:01,730
Do you know you've made a real big mistake?

6
0:01:02,800 --> 0:01:03,820
Shut up!

7
0:01:05,230 --> 0:01:07,020
You've followed me for 3 days

8
0:01:07,400 --> 0:01:09,330
I didn't beat you up because you're a woman

9
0:01:09,660 --> 0:01:11,180
Don't think that I'm afraid of you

10
0:01:11,800 --> 0:01:12,890
Monkey King

11
0:01:13,200 --> 0:01:15,850
be polite to Goddess!

12
0:01:16,200 --> 0:01:18,180
Shut up

13
0:01:19,200 --> 0:01:20,990
You scare me again

14
0:01:22,990 --> 0:01:24,290
If you're not scared of me

15
0:01:24,500 --> 0:01:25,820
you needn't hurt Purple Fairy

16
0:01:25,860 --> 0:01:27,950
and stole her Pandora's Box

17
0:01:28,200 --> 0:01:30,130
You just wanna escape

18
0:01:30,330 --> 0:01:31,920
Now, I can't escape

19
0:01:32,130 --> 0:01:33,690
I will fight with you

20
0:01:35,090 --> 0:01:36,250
What's up?

21
0:01:38,560 --> 0:01:40,260
Don't be angry

22
0:01:40,460 --> 0:01:42,450
You may violate the rule

23
0:01:42,700 --> 0:01:44,520
Monkey King, you're so naughty!

24
0:01:44,730 --> 0:01:45,690
I've told you

25
0:01:45,930 --> 0:01:48,290
not to throw things!

26
0:01:48,330 --> 0:01:49,060
Look!

27
0:01:49,330 --> 0:01:51,420
You've thrown away the stick

28
0:01:51,660 --> 0:01:52,850
Pandora's Box is the treasure

29
0:01:53,090 --> 0:01:55,030
You'll pollute the environment

30
0:01:55,400 --> 0:01:56,990
You'll hurt kids

31
0:01:57,200 --> 0:01:58,220
If there are no kids

32
0:01:58,430 --> 0:02:01,490
it is bad to hurt plants

33
0:02:03,030 --> 0:02:04,290
What's up?

34
0:02:04,560 --> 0:02:05,690
Let go!

35
0:02:05,890 --> 0:02:07,020
You want?

36
0:02:07,260 --> 0:02:09,390
Speak up if you want!

37
0:02:09,600 --> 0:02:11,490
Why do you keep silent?

38
0:02:11,730 --> 0:02:13,220
Although your eyes are full of sincerity

39
0:02:13,430 --> 0:02:16,390
I'm very glad, you still have to speak up

40
0:02:16,630 --> 0:02:17,490
Do you really like?

41
0:02:17,730 --> 0:02:19,090
Take it

42
0:02:19,300 --> 0:02:20,660
Do you really like?

43
0:02:20,930 --> 0:02:21,890
You

44
0:02:21,930 --> 0:02:23,220
Damn!

45
0:02:24,600 --> 0:02:27,060
Monkey King...

46
0:02:27,890 --> 0:02:29,290
See

47
0:02:29,500 --> 0:02:30,980
this guy keeps talking all the time

48
0:02:31,160 --> 0:02:32,560
we don't know what he's talking about

49
0:02:32,790 --> 0:02:35,350
He's just like a fly hanging around

50
0:02:36,930 --> 0:02:38,550
Sorry, not a fly

51
0:02:38,790 --> 0:02:41,020
It's a swarm of flies flying near your ears

52
0:02:45,430 --> 0:02:47,950
Flying into your brain

53
0:02:48,860 --> 0:02:51,660
Help!

54
0:02:55,130 --> 0:02:57,650
Help!

55
0:02:59,730 --> 0:03:02,460
So I catch that fly. Open its belly

56
0:03:02,500 --> 0:03:03,430
Take out its intestine

57
0:03:03,660 --> 0:03:05,150
Put its intestine around its own neck

58
0:03:05,200 --> 0:03:07,220
Then I pull the intestine tightly

59
0:03:07,930 --> 0:03:10,550
The tongue comes out

60
0:03:10,760 --> 0:03:11,780
I use a blade and cut!

61
0:03:11,830 --> 0:03:13,420
Wow!

62
0:03:15,790 --> 0:03:19,020
All the people keep silent

63
0:03:21,690 --> 0:03:28,560
Now you know why I need to kill

64
0:03:29,300 --> 0:03:31,630
Monkey King, you have so many excuses

65
0:03:31,860 --> 0:03:33,950
You don't want to get scriptures in the west

66
0:03:35,060 --> 0:03:37,220
Shut up please! Beat!

67
0:03:51,930 --> 0:03:53,190
I've got a super body. You can't hurt me

68
0:03:53,430 --> 0:03:55,160
I don't scare of any god

69
0:04:08,560 --> 0:04:10,930
I'm detroy all devils

70
0:04:11,690 --> 0:04:13,590
Being master I should take the responsibility

71
0:04:13,790 --> 0:04:15,660
Please let him go!

72
0:04:15,860 --> 0:04:18,850
I have to do so I need to report to Heaven Emperor

73
0:04:19,060 --> 0:04:20,720
Goddess, please tell Heaven Emperor

74
0:04:20,960 --> 0:04:23,150
I can sacrifice my life for him

75
0:04:34,060 --> 0:04:38,690
Namonitabhaya...

76
0:06:48,660 --> 0:06:50,180
What did he said?

77
0:06:52,160 --> 0:06:53,150
Give him the pork

78
0:06:55,060 --> 0:06:55,920
Stand by!

79
0:06:56,160 --> 0:06:57,250
A woman is coming in!

80
0:06:57,490 --> 0:06:59,760
Asst. Master do you think soldiers are coming?

81
0:06:59,990 --> 0:07:01,820
This is why you're called Blind Bing

82
0:07:02,300 --> 0:07:04,690
Didn't you see Dumby shaking his ass?

83
0:07:05,060 --> 0:07:07,430
Do you think he has hemorrhoids?

84
0:07:07,790 --> 0:07:09,160
OK, even if he has hemorrhoids

85
0:07:09,360 --> 0:07:11,450
he is a soldier with hemorrhoids

86
0:07:11,660 --> 0:07:12,680
So what to be feared about him?

87
0:07:39,630 --> 0:07:40,850
Who the hell you are?

88
0:07:41,630 --> 0:07:44,990
Don't you reckon I'm a woman?

89
0:07:48,090 --> 0:07:49,750
What do you come here for?

90
0:07:50,690 --> 0:07:52,790
The world's gone mad

91
0:07:53,030 --> 0:07:53,820
A weary lady

92
0:07:54,030 --> 0:07:56,190
Iooking for a shelter

93
0:07:56,460 --> 0:07:58,320
I wanna brush off the dust of my past

94
0:07:58,830 --> 0:08:01,920
Do you know what place it is?

95
0:08:02,530 --> 0:08:05,690
This is not a nice place You all look gruesome

96
0:08:07,060 --> 0:08:09,220
I don't think it is a decent tavern

97
0:08:09,430 --> 0:08:11,550
Is this a slaughter-house?

98
0:08:12,130 --> 0:08:15,030
Yes, we are. How dare you come in

99
0:08:15,560 --> 0:08:18,190
You're in danger already

100
0:08:19,400 --> 0:08:21,330
I'm not sure who's in danger

101
0:08:21,560 --> 0:08:23,390
I think you're in danger

102
0:08:23,730 --> 0:08:26,020
You can be robbers

103
0:08:26,200 --> 0:08:29,130
So can I

104
0:08:30,890 --> 0:08:33,050
Who the hell you are?

105
0:08:43,530 --> 0:08:44,820
Blossom

106
0:08:45,130 --> 0:08:48,090
Nothing get into my way and survive

107
0:08:48,300 --> 0:08:50,560
Money or your heads

108
0:08:59,230 --> 0:09:02,750
Why does Ma'am 30th come to Mt Wuyue?

109
0:09:03,260 --> 0:09:06,950
This devil is a fierce robber

110
0:09:07,630 --> 0:09:11,560
Is here having big business?

111
0:09:15,430 --> 0:09:16,390
Why do you still

112
0:09:16,590 --> 0:09:17,890
put the money on your head?

113
0:09:18,200 --> 0:09:19,220
Put it back!

114
0:09:19,390 --> 0:09:21,620
She said it is our head or the money Master

115
0:09:21,830 --> 0:09:22,760
What are you talking about?

116
0:09:23,230 --> 0:09:26,020
Asst. Master!

117
0:09:27,060 --> 0:09:28,690
You coward! How can you be my assistant?

118
0:09:28,890 --> 0:09:31,330
Master, I'm not Asst. Master! I'm Blind Bing!

119
0:09:31,560 --> 0:09:32,150
He is Asst. Master

120
0:09:32,360 --> 0:09:33,490
I will make you regret!

121
0:09:34,230 --> 0:09:35,560
I will make you regret!

122
0:09:36,360 --> 0:09:38,120
Go away!

123
0:09:38,530 --> 0:09:40,860
Look at yourself Mousing around, so shameful

124
0:09:41,090 --> 0:09:42,190
How can you follow me around with their hair?

125
0:09:42,460 --> 0:09:44,620
How can you follow me around with their hair?

126
0:09:44,830 --> 0:09:46,990
Master, I'm here!

127
0:09:47,390 --> 0:09:48,360
Come out!

128
0:09:48,560 --> 0:09:49,750
Coming

129
0:09:50,230 --> 0:09:51,960
Master, you're hit by Kunlun Sage's 7 Ultimate Fists

130
0:09:52,160 --> 0:09:53,590
Your wounds are spreading

131
0:09:53,890 --> 0:09:54,880
Shut up

132
0:09:55,090 --> 0:09:56,290
you knelt down that time

133
0:09:56,490 --> 0:09:57,960
and I got hit in the nose

134
0:09:58,160 --> 0:09:59,420
Master, here!

135
0:09:59,790 --> 0:10:02,060
The 7 Ultimate Fists really hurt Master

136
0:10:02,290 --> 0:10:04,690
Master, I was scared, so I knelt down

137
0:10:04,930 --> 0:10:06,050
It is heard that people who got hit by the 7 Ultimate Fists

138
0:10:06,290 --> 0:10:07,320
will have disease in his eyes

139
0:10:07,530 --> 0:10:09,260
Then he'll become dumb

140
0:10:09,490 --> 0:10:11,650
After that he can't speak properly

141
0:10:11,890 --> 0:10:14,420
At last, his body explodes and he's dead

142
0:10:14,630 --> 0:10:15,750
Master, there's something wrong with your eyes!

143
0:10:16,030 --> 0:10:16,820
I am OK!

144
0:10:17,060 --> 0:10:18,320
I only concentrate my eyesight on a single point

145
0:10:18,560 --> 0:10:20,550
I only change my usual way of vision

146
0:10:20,790 --> 0:10:22,380
Do you want to take my position?

147
0:10:22,630 --> 0:10:23,920
No, Master, I don't dare

148
0:10:24,260 --> 0:10:25,660
You don't dare? I am gonna kill you!

149
0:10:26,290 --> 0:10:27,260
Kill you!

150
0:10:27,530 --> 0:10:29,720
Can you cry out for me?

151
0:10:30,830 --> 0:10:31,990
Ah...

152
0:10:32,460 --> 0:10:35,220
Ok, let's get our weapons and search

153
0:10:35,260 --> 0:10:36,730
Ma'am 30th

154
0:10:37,560 --> 0:10:39,620
No need to scare! I'm here!

155
0:10:44,690 --> 0:10:46,350
I'm the leader of the Axe Gang

156
0:10:46,560 --> 0:10:49,290
My nickname is Joker

157
0:10:49,560 --> 0:10:52,050
It is nice to meet famous Ma'am 30th

158
0:10:52,260 --> 0:10:53,820
What are you gonna

159
0:10:53,860 --> 0:10:55,550
do here?

160
0:10:56,890 --> 0:10:58,720
I just wanna stay here for a while

161
0:10:59,330 --> 0:11:01,520
A while? How long is it?

162
0:11:01,730 --> 0:11:03,250
3 full days

163
0:11:04,860 --> 0:11:07,090
Maybe 30 or 50 years

164
0:11:07,460 --> 0:11:09,320
I'll leave when I meet the person

165
0:11:09,560 --> 0:11:10,550
who I want to see

166
0:11:12,130 --> 0:11:13,820
I don't think you can wait so long

167
0:11:17,990 --> 0:11:18,980
What are you doing?

168
0:11:19,200 --> 0:11:20,460
I've just had a piss!

169
0:11:21,390 --> 0:11:22,450
You had a piss here?

170
0:11:22,660 --> 0:11:24,390
This is why you have so much water to bath

171
0:11:24,590 --> 0:11:25,580
What are you talking about?

172
0:11:25,830 --> 0:11:28,220
I said live to see that person

173
0:11:35,960 --> 0:11:40,020
Master...

174
0:12:05,960 --> 0:12:07,590
I'm not that easy to kill

175
0:12:07,890 --> 0:12:09,690
Ask my brothers first

176
0:12:13,590 --> 0:12:15,690
You have no guts...

177
0:12:16,030 --> 0:12:19,290
You betray me!

178
0:12:19,530 --> 0:12:21,580
God!

179
0:12:22,860 --> 0:12:24,620
Kill us all if you can!

180
0:12:27,230 --> 0:12:28,660
Forgive me...

181
0:12:28,930 --> 0:12:29,760
Forgive me, heroine...

182
0:12:29,990 --> 0:12:31,760
Stupid! Do you think she will let you go?

183
0:12:32,390 --> 0:12:33,920
I'm gonna fight

184
0:12:34,160 --> 0:12:35,290
even if I lost my life!

185
0:12:35,530 --> 0:12:38,930
That's fine. Since you're willing to beg me

186
0:12:39,190 --> 0:12:41,490
I won't kill you now

187
0:12:41,760 --> 0:12:43,590
Thanks a lot!...

188
0:12:43,790 --> 0:12:47,250
You...you're so righteous!

189
0:12:56,660 --> 0:12:58,320
You're so good!

190
0:13:00,330 --> 0:13:02,730
You all clean your sole and wait for me outside

191
0:13:09,830 --> 0:13:10,790
Why is there a scar?

192
0:13:11,090 --> 0:13:12,650
This is not a scar, it is only dirt

193
0:13:12,860 --> 0:13:13,520
Go clean it

194
0:13:13,790 --> 0:13:14,850
or I'll cut the whole leg off

195
0:13:15,160 --> 0:13:16,130
Master

196
0:13:16,390 --> 0:13:17,690
why she wanna see our sole?

197
0:13:17,930 --> 0:13:19,950
It is lucky that you don't wanna see our ass

198
0:13:20,430 --> 0:13:21,150
Are you scared?

199
0:13:21,360 --> 0:13:22,660
I'm not! You are scared!

200
0:13:22,930 --> 0:13:23,590
Why?

201
0:13:23,830 --> 0:13:24,850
You have hemorrhoids

202
0:13:25,090 --> 0:13:25,750
She'll say they are not clean enough

203
0:13:26,060 --> 0:13:26,820
and cut them off

204
0:13:27,060 --> 0:13:27,960
Why do you know I have hemorrhoids?

205
0:13:28,190 --> 0:13:29,960
Blind Bing peeped on your shower

206
0:13:30,460 --> 0:13:31,860
Why did you peep on me?

207
0:13:32,230 --> 0:13:33,190
I not only peeped on you

208
0:13:33,430 --> 0:13:34,980
I've peeped on you all

209
0:13:38,390 --> 0:13:39,920
Why is there so much hair?

210
0:13:40,130 --> 0:13:40,820
Sure

211
0:13:41,030 --> 0:13:42,790
I've got more in other parts

212
0:13:42,830 --> 0:13:43,490
What?

213
0:13:43,760 --> 0:13:44,750
Are you excited now?

214
0:13:44,990 --> 0:13:49,120
Where did you say has more hair?

215
0:13:49,390 --> 0:13:50,330
No

216
0:13:50,530 --> 0:13:52,190
in fact I only have hair on my head and sole

217
0:13:52,390 --> 0:13:54,020
Do you think they grow on the wrong places?

218
0:13:55,460 --> 0:13:57,690
From now on, I'll check all the people

219
0:13:57,930 --> 0:13:59,150
passing here!

220
0:13:59,990 --> 0:14:01,320
Check what?

221
0:14:01,860 --> 0:14:03,190
Check their sole

222
0:14:03,390 --> 0:14:05,380
If you discover a guy having three birthmarks, tell me

223
0:14:13,230 --> 0:14:15,020
Master! We don't go to rob

224
0:14:15,260 --> 0:14:16,230
but check people's sole

225
0:14:16,490 --> 0:14:19,480
If the others know that they'll say we're perverts

226
0:14:19,760 --> 0:14:21,920
We can plot against her

227
0:14:22,130 --> 0:14:23,890
Poison her, make her faint

228
0:14:23,930 --> 0:14:24,860
then rape and kill her!

229
0:14:25,160 --> 0:14:26,130
A good plot!

230
0:14:26,360 --> 0:14:27,520
You think so

231
0:14:27,760 --> 0:14:29,280
You shall administer the plan

232
0:14:29,660 --> 0:14:31,290
I don't think I can do this

233
0:14:31,730 --> 0:14:33,990
I go, no need to kneel down

234
0:14:34,230 --> 0:14:37,060
I don't want to! I can't control my legs

235
0:14:37,260 --> 0:14:38,990
Master, your wound is expanding

236
0:14:39,230 --> 0:14:40,960
I still have both hands

237
0:14:41,460 --> 0:14:43,820
I won't give up!

238
0:14:48,490 --> 0:14:49,930
Master has fallen into a shit pit!

239
0:14:50,130 --> 0:14:51,250
Master!

240
0:15:33,330 --> 0:15:35,750
Have you found the three birthmarks?

241
0:15:36,390 --> 0:15:38,790
Why does everyone tell me to find the three birthmarks?

242
0:15:38,960 --> 0:15:41,120
You can save him when you find them

243
0:15:41,560 --> 0:15:42,390
What are you talking about?

244
0:15:42,660 --> 0:15:43,420
Where are we?

245
0:15:43,930 --> 0:15:45,120
Who?

246
0:15:48,290 --> 0:15:49,080
Dreaming

247
0:15:51,820 --> 0:15:52,850
Did you kill that bitch?

248
0:15:59,120 --> 0:16:02,510
Spider! Spider...

249
0:16:03,260 --> 0:16:04,610
It's only a spider

250
0:16:04,760 --> 0:16:05,850
It's big

251
0:16:05,860 --> 0:16:06,310
How big is it?

252
0:16:10,320 --> 0:16:12,280
I've told you to tidy up the place

253
0:16:12,490 --> 0:16:14,080
The spiders are bigger than me

254
0:16:14,090 --> 0:16:15,250
What should I do?

255
0:16:17,820 --> 0:16:19,980
It keeps running after me

256
0:16:20,160 --> 0:16:21,850
Maybe I'm handsome

257
0:16:34,610 --> 0:16:35,380
What?

258
0:17:19,510 --> 0:17:20,270
What's up?

259
0:17:20,280 --> 0:17:20,850
A spider is running after Master?

260
0:17:21,030 --> 0:17:21,950
This way? No...

261
0:17:22,090 --> 0:17:23,090
This way!

262
0:17:24,530 --> 0:17:25,850
Fine, be quick!

263
0:17:28,060 --> 0:17:29,320
How come?

264
0:17:37,590 --> 0:17:38,480
Help!

265
0:17:38,730 --> 0:17:42,880
Come here! I'm here!

266
0:17:43,160 --> 0:17:44,650
Be quick!

267
0:17:45,390 --> 0:17:46,690
I'm here!

268
0:17:47,790 --> 0:17:49,420
Help me!

269
0:17:50,720 --> 0:17:51,950
Blind Bing!

270
0:17:52,160 --> 0:17:53,750
Nothing in the front! Turn back, turn back!

271
0:17:53,960 --> 0:17:55,620
No! it's Master! Master...

272
0:17:55,830 --> 0:17:57,310
Isn't it a cockroach?

273
0:17:57,360 --> 0:17:58,520
It's Master

274
0:17:58,760 --> 0:17:59,690
Great! Go!

275
0:18:00,990 --> 0:18:02,010
You sons of bitches, deceive me

276
0:18:03,360 --> 0:18:04,820
Master, I'm coming

277
0:18:11,920 --> 0:18:13,610
What am I touching?

278
0:18:14,090 --> 0:18:15,320
Master is saved...

279
0:18:17,590 --> 0:18:20,850
Asst. Master is so happy What is he holding?

280
0:18:21,490 --> 0:18:23,820
Master, didn't he carry you out?

281
0:18:26,850 --> 0:18:28,580
I'm fine, let's go home...

282
0:18:28,860 --> 0:18:29,890
Take a bath, go to bed sooner

283
0:18:30,130 --> 0:18:31,110
Don't hang around tonight

284
0:18:33,060 --> 0:18:33,580
Let go!

285
0:18:33,890 --> 0:18:34,820
Spider!

286
0:18:35,090 --> 0:18:36,820
Spider!

287
0:18:37,860 --> 0:18:39,380
Blindy, Help

288
0:18:39,930 --> 0:18:41,220
Who?

289
0:18:46,390 --> 0:18:47,680
Burn it!

290
0:18:47,790 --> 0:18:51,590
Have a rest first

291
0:18:58,780 --> 0:19:01,040
Burn it!

292
0:19:01,480 --> 0:19:03,240
Don't let him go...burn it

293
0:19:04,480 --> 0:19:05,780
Burn it!

294
0:19:05,820 --> 0:19:06,940
No need to be frightened

295
0:19:07,220 --> 0:19:08,510
Burn him...

296
0:19:08,550 --> 0:19:10,110
He's there...

297
0:19:10,620 --> 0:19:12,140
It's over there, go there...

298
0:19:12,150 --> 0:19:13,840
Here is another

299
0:19:14,060 --> 0:19:15,320
This one is smaller

300
0:19:25,650 --> 0:19:26,640
Freeze!

301
0:19:41,110 --> 0:19:42,100
Where?

302
0:19:42,660 --> 0:19:44,490
It's there!

303
0:19:44,860 --> 0:19:45,880
There!

304
0:19:46,060 --> 0:19:47,390
There!

305
0:20:03,960 --> 0:20:06,720
Only two claws are left Let me break you in half

306
0:20:11,590 --> 0:20:13,120
Go to hell

307
0:20:20,890 --> 0:20:21,920
Don't go!

308
0:20:23,230 --> 0:20:25,350
It's here

309
0:20:26,660 --> 0:20:33,250
Beat it!

310
0:20:37,060 --> 0:20:37,790
Give it to me

311
0:20:42,430 --> 0:20:45,390
All spread out! Let me burn it!

312
0:20:45,630 --> 0:20:47,560
Go to hell!

313
0:20:49,490 --> 0:20:50,650
Burning!

314
0:20:51,560 --> 0:20:52,990
Very hot!

315
0:20:54,660 --> 0:20:56,060
It's Master's voice

316
0:20:56,290 --> 0:20:57,520
Help!

317
0:20:58,060 --> 0:20:59,420
It's Master. Help him!

318
0:20:59,630 --> 0:21:00,420
It's Master

319
0:21:00,690 --> 0:21:01,920
Help!

320
0:21:03,260 --> 0:21:05,390
Master, your cock is burning

321
0:21:05,590 --> 0:21:06,990
Be quick

322
0:21:07,230 --> 0:21:08,190
Get the water...

323
0:21:08,390 --> 0:21:09,090
Put out the fire

324
0:21:09,330 --> 0:21:10,190
Put out the fire

325
0:21:10,430 --> 0:21:11,220
Dying!

326
0:21:11,490 --> 0:21:12,360
Be quick

327
0:21:12,930 --> 0:21:14,950
I'm going to out the fire, too

328
0:21:15,290 --> 0:21:17,780
You can't put out the fire with straw Stay away!

329
0:21:18,060 --> 0:21:18,820
Master, it's OK!

330
0:21:21,060 --> 0:21:22,650
I'll put it out!

331
0:21:22,890 --> 0:21:24,760
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop burning...

332
0:21:25,190 --> 0:21:27,090
Out you go...!

333
0:21:27,430 --> 0:21:29,820
Stop burning!

334
0:21:30,490 --> 0:21:32,890
I can't take this...

335
0:21:48,630 --> 0:21:50,220
The fire is out! Are you OK?

336
0:21:51,660 --> 0:21:54,720
You have to step on him and put the fire out

337
0:21:54,990 --> 0:21:56,250
Moron!

338
0:21:58,960 --> 0:21:59,950
Who burned me?

339
0:22:00,260 --> 0:22:01,190
Not me!

340
0:22:01,390 --> 0:22:02,020
I have no idea

341
0:22:03,390 --> 0:22:05,220
I know it's you!

342
0:22:05,690 --> 0:22:07,850
I know what you're thinking!

343
0:22:08,090 --> 0:22:09,020
You wanna take my place!

344
0:22:09,190 --> 0:22:10,020
No...Master...

345
0:22:10,260 --> 0:22:11,280
Master's eyes are Ok

346
0:22:11,660 --> 0:22:12,750
No, I didn't do that

347
0:22:12,960 --> 0:22:15,290
Master, you've recovered

348
0:22:15,930 --> 0:22:17,050
I'm cured! Why?

349
0:22:18,160 --> 0:22:19,020
I know!

350
0:22:19,230 --> 0:22:20,820
You must hurt yourself in order to

351
0:22:21,090 --> 0:22:21,650
cure the wounds

352
0:22:22,330 --> 0:22:23,820
It's reasonable!

353
0:22:24,090 --> 0:22:25,990
You have to thank Asst. Master

354
0:22:26,190 --> 0:22:27,590
If he didn't hit you at the crotch

355
0:22:27,830 --> 0:22:29,190
you won't be healed so fast

356
0:22:29,390 --> 0:22:31,330
Do you have an affair with him?

357
0:22:31,560 --> 0:22:32,920
I love you so much

358
0:22:33,230 --> 0:22:34,950
Go to hell! Stop it!

359
0:22:36,830 --> 0:22:38,550
I've told you to kill Ma'am 30th

360
0:22:38,830 --> 0:22:39,620
Have you done that?

361
0:22:39,830 --> 0:22:40,760
Ma'am 30th is a devil!

362
0:22:41,190 --> 0:22:42,720
Spider Woman!

363
0:22:43,060 --> 0:22:44,890
I'm a rational man

364
0:22:45,090 --> 0:22:47,320
I can't accept such ridiculous thing!

365
0:22:47,560 --> 0:22:48,360
Kill her!

366
0:22:48,530 --> 0:22:50,080
Master, aren't you scared?

367
0:22:50,330 --> 0:22:51,850
Of course not! I'm healed

368
0:22:52,090 --> 0:22:52,790
I will defeat her!

369
0:22:52,960 --> 0:22:54,390
Great! You have guts!

370
0:22:54,630 --> 0:22:56,180
You said I had guts?

371
0:22:56,390 --> 0:22:57,790
Yes, but forget I'd say that

372
0:22:57,830 --> 0:22:58,720
Master

373
0:22:58,990 --> 0:23:01,150
You just get into her room and finish her off

374
0:23:01,430 --> 0:23:02,590
We'll cover you up!

375
0:23:02,890 --> 0:23:03,980
Why I go first everytime...

376
0:23:16,190 --> 0:23:18,160
You said you would cover me up so stay closer

377
0:23:18,360 --> 0:23:19,290
Steady

378
0:23:19,460 --> 0:23:21,220
we've got weapons

379
0:23:21,430 --> 0:23:23,090
We'll throw them at her

380
0:23:24,160 --> 0:23:25,850
You'll kill me, too

381
0:23:26,130 --> 0:23:27,090
Don't be silly!

382
0:23:27,290 --> 0:23:29,090
You won't die, you'll only get hurt!

383
0:23:33,430 --> 0:23:34,590
Sons of bitches!

384
0:23:37,060 --> 0:23:39,690
Get! You are not fooling me

385
0:23:39,930 --> 0:23:40,790
Listen to me

386
0:23:41,560 --> 0:23:43,030
Stop that

387
0:23:44,530 --> 0:23:45,460
Fainted?

388
0:23:45,660 --> 0:23:46,490
Big Cow, Younger Tiger

389
0:23:48,590 --> 0:23:51,820
You're all useless. Let me do this

390
0:24:01,190 --> 0:24:02,420
What?

391
0:24:03,390 --> 0:24:04,920
You faked the fainted?

392
0:24:06,190 --> 0:24:08,090
This is a tactic

393
0:24:08,360 --> 0:24:10,020
It is very useful

394
0:24:14,730 --> 0:24:16,060
Where is the leak?

395
0:24:17,590 --> 0:24:19,790
Asst. Master, you're bleeding

396
0:24:20,190 --> 0:24:22,490
Don't scare!

397
0:24:22,730 --> 0:24:24,690
I can stop the bleeding

398
0:24:24,930 --> 0:24:26,050
by myself

399
0:24:43,660 --> 0:24:45,180
it's not picturesque

400
0:24:45,390 --> 0:24:46,760
but it is unique

401
0:24:46,960 --> 0:24:49,090
You may love this place, eventually

402
0:24:49,290 --> 0:24:50,280
Good night!

403
0:24:54,690 --> 0:24:56,780
Master...

404
0:24:56,990 --> 0:24:57,960
She is a devil!

405
0:24:57,990 --> 0:24:59,050
Yes!

406
0:24:59,390 --> 0:25:00,860
She is a real devil!

407
0:25:01,130 --> 0:25:03,960
My heart is pounding!

408
0:25:05,090 --> 0:25:06,520
Master, stop it!

409
0:25:10,530 --> 0:25:14,320
You're a righteous man, a hero

410
0:25:14,530 --> 0:25:15,920
It is my pleasure

411
0:25:16,190 --> 0:25:17,520
to be your friend

412
0:25:17,730 --> 0:25:19,350
The money put on your bros' heads

413
0:25:19,590 --> 0:25:21,180
is all given to you to buy drinks

414
0:25:22,630 --> 0:25:24,750
Thank you very much, Ma'am 30th

415
0:25:26,130 --> 0:25:27,990
Master, she's not really good-looking

416
0:25:28,560 --> 0:25:29,890
But I like her!

417
0:25:35,790 --> 0:25:37,880
Only thrust the thigh once but there're so many holes

418
0:25:38,160 --> 0:25:39,250
What do you mean?

419
0:25:49,930 --> 0:25:52,390
Sister, why did you leave?

420
0:25:52,660 --> 0:25:54,020
You ran to this poor village

421
0:25:54,260 --> 0:25:54,990
and you're forced to reveal

422
0:25:55,260 --> 0:25:57,450
your real image

423
0:25:57,760 --> 0:25:58,620
What are you doing here?

424
0:25:58,790 --> 0:25:59,780
How about you?

425
0:26:00,330 --> 0:26:01,660
I just want to have a walk

426
0:26:03,160 --> 0:26:04,920
You're waiting for the Longevity Monk

427
0:26:05,190 --> 0:26:07,090
you wanna eat his flesh

428
0:26:07,360 --> 0:26:08,220
You can make Granpa Buddha

429
0:26:08,260 --> 0:26:09,820
speak out this top secret

430
0:26:10,130 --> 0:26:11,220
So do I

431
0:26:11,490 --> 0:26:12,460
Nonsense!

432
0:26:12,660 --> 0:26:15,460
Nonsense? Why did you come to Mt Wuyue?

433
0:26:15,660 --> 0:26:17,020
This was called Fingers Mountain in the past

434
0:26:17,230 --> 0:26:19,450
It's the prison for this monkey

435
0:26:19,660 --> 0:26:21,290
The top secret says that he'll become human

436
0:26:21,490 --> 0:26:23,930
and he has three birthmarks on his sole

437
0:26:24,490 --> 0:26:26,760
you can find the Monk if you know where Monkey King is

438
0:26:26,930 --> 0:26:29,890
Sister, do you still think I'm speaking nonsense?

439
0:26:30,130 --> 0:26:32,490
You just want to see that monkey

440
0:26:33,060 --> 0:26:35,820
You can do nothing even if you see him

441
0:26:36,030 --> 0:26:38,690
The difference is that he died in Goddess's hands last time

442
0:26:39,160 --> 0:26:41,590
but he died in my hands this time

443
0:26:42,090 --> 0:26:43,420
It will benefit

444
0:26:43,660 --> 0:26:44,920
only one person

445
0:26:45,330 --> 0:26:46,790
You know the reason!

446
0:26:48,090 --> 0:26:49,220
Do you wanna fight over him with me?

447
0:26:52,690 --> 0:26:53,920
Do you think only you can fake face?

448
0:26:57,590 --> 0:26:58,790
Who?

449
0:27:08,290 --> 0:27:10,560
Devil...!

450
0:27:20,960 --> 0:27:21,690
What did you see?

451
0:27:21,930 --> 0:27:22,550
Nothing

452
0:27:22,760 --> 0:27:23,450
No!

453
0:27:23,730 --> 0:27:24,750
What are you doing down there?

454
0:27:25,130 --> 0:27:26,150
I wanna tie the lace

455
0:27:35,930 --> 0:27:37,790
If the secret of the monk leaked

456
0:27:37,990 --> 0:27:39,150
I'll kill you

457
0:27:41,290 --> 0:27:42,520
Then, all devils gather at Fingers Mountain

458
0:27:42,730 --> 0:27:44,660
beg for the flesh of the Longevity Monk

459
0:27:45,090 --> 0:27:47,650
Tell the King about this

460
0:27:47,930 --> 0:27:49,590
he will bestow on us

461
0:27:54,130 --> 0:27:57,620
Even a bull is talking So many devils here this time

462
0:27:57,860 --> 0:27:59,260
Go...go away

463
0:28:00,330 --> 0:28:01,850
If I go now, I'm a coward!

464
0:28:02,390 --> 0:28:03,950
No, report to Master

465
0:28:05,190 --> 0:28:06,520
Master

466
0:28:06,790 --> 0:28:08,260
This mountain was called

467
0:28:08,530 --> 0:28:09,460
Fingers Mountain in the past

468
0:28:09,690 --> 0:28:11,680
The Longevity Monk and the Monkey King will meet here

469
0:28:11,990 --> 0:28:14,190
My bull is talking

470
0:28:14,430 --> 0:28:15,090
Those two things

471
0:28:15,290 --> 0:28:18,020
one has 8 legs, one's head...

472
0:28:19,930 --> 0:28:21,020
You two haven't slept?

473
0:28:21,260 --> 0:28:22,060
What are you talking about?

474
0:28:25,990 --> 0:28:26,960
ah...

475
0:28:27,160 --> 0:28:29,250
Two baby pigs are born

476
0:28:29,460 --> 0:28:32,290
One has 8 legs

477
0:28:32,530 --> 0:28:34,490
One has a very heavy head

478
0:28:34,690 --> 0:28:36,090
Master, we're rich now

479
0:28:36,390 --> 0:28:37,830
We needn't to be robbers anymore...

480
0:28:38,090 --> 0:28:38,890
We didn't rear any pigs

481
0:28:39,160 --> 0:28:40,220
We didn't rear any pigs?

482
0:28:40,530 --> 0:28:42,620
Or I'm speaking in my dream!

483
0:28:42,830 --> 0:28:45,020
Ok, I'm leaving, please take a rest

484
0:28:45,460 --> 0:28:46,150
We're leaving

485
0:28:46,390 --> 0:28:47,520
Walk both girls away

486
0:28:47,730 --> 0:28:48,620
No!

487
0:28:49,030 --> 0:28:51,190
I will order someone to search for

488
0:28:51,430 --> 0:28:53,360
the guy you wanna see

489
0:28:53,760 --> 0:28:54,920
Thank you master

490
0:28:56,190 --> 0:28:58,090
Good night! Go!

491
0:28:59,290 --> 0:29:00,880
Go! Go!

492
0:29:04,490 --> 0:29:05,650
Nothing can be done this time

493
0:29:05,890 --> 0:29:07,650
Why does Jing Jing have no reaction

494
0:29:07,960 --> 0:29:09,390
to this image?

495
0:29:10,460 --> 0:29:11,360
Nothing I can do

496
0:29:16,160 --> 0:29:17,320
Go!

497
0:29:24,390 --> 0:29:28,950
Don't kill me!...Don't kill me!

498
0:29:31,260 --> 0:29:32,660
I just wanna have fun with you

499
0:29:33,130 --> 0:29:34,350
Do you like playing?

500
0:29:34,830 --> 0:29:35,520
Come and have fun

501
0:29:39,690 --> 0:29:40,660
Is it funny?

502
0:29:40,860 --> 0:29:41,590
Yes!

503
0:29:41,860 --> 0:29:42,830
Ok, let's play again

504
0:29:51,360 --> 0:29:52,380
Play again?

505
0:29:52,690 --> 0:29:54,630
I don't wanna play...

506
0:29:54,890 --> 0:29:56,320
You said who's got eight claws?

507
0:29:56,360 --> 0:29:57,830
I can't remember it...

508
0:29:58,360 --> 0:29:59,350
What?

509
0:30:01,460 --> 0:30:02,930
No!

510
0:30:03,490 --> 0:30:05,650
My head looks like this?

511
0:30:06,130 --> 0:30:07,680
Yes...! Oh no!

512
0:30:08,160 --> 0:30:10,720
She's not changed yet

513
0:30:14,090 --> 0:30:15,890
Not yet?

514
0:30:18,830 --> 0:30:19,720
I'll kill him

515
0:30:19,890 --> 0:30:20,550
No

516
0:30:21,760 --> 0:30:22,820
Why?

517
0:30:23,860 --> 0:30:26,220
I'm gonna mesmerize him

518
0:30:26,460 --> 0:30:27,890
he'll be my undercover agent

519
0:30:32,360 --> 0:30:32,850
Hi!

520
0:30:32,890 --> 0:30:34,480
Ghost!

521
0:30:35,390 --> 0:30:36,450
Go to have a look

522
0:30:37,330 --> 0:30:39,490
You said a ghost!

523
0:30:39,690 --> 0:30:41,090
Oh dear!

524
0:30:42,730 --> 0:30:45,490
Don't be pretentious around here

525
0:30:45,660 --> 0:30:47,720
Or I will cut you into pieces

526
0:30:48,390 --> 0:30:49,520
You're so brutal!

527
0:30:49,690 --> 0:30:50,720
Look at me!

528
0:30:51,390 --> 0:30:52,830
Mesmerizing!

529
0:31:01,260 --> 0:31:02,250
Who?

530
0:31:03,130 --> 0:31:05,250
It's a long night, no mood to sleep

531
0:31:05,490 --> 0:31:07,550
I thought I am the only one

532
0:31:07,760 --> 0:31:10,750
But Jing Jing, you're sleepless, too?

533
0:31:13,890 --> 0:31:17,290
Yes, why can't you sleep?

534
0:31:17,760 --> 0:31:20,250
Just because of Jing Jing!

535
0:31:20,490 --> 0:31:21,690
Me?

536
0:31:22,230 --> 0:31:24,620
yes, when I saw you

537
0:31:24,860 --> 0:31:27,490
I made up my mind that I wouldn't be a robber

538
0:31:27,730 --> 0:31:30,320
I just wanna show my sincerity

539
0:31:30,530 --> 0:31:32,820
I can't face my past

540
0:31:33,190 --> 0:31:34,250
Like what you see?

541
0:31:35,790 --> 0:31:37,090
You're monkey?

542
0:31:37,730 --> 0:31:38,660
Monkey?

543
0:31:38,990 --> 0:31:39,750
Monkey King

544
0:31:40,090 --> 0:31:41,020
Monkey King?

545
0:31:41,190 --> 0:31:42,090
You think you're alright with a human face?

546
0:31:42,260 --> 0:31:43,250
Human Face?

547
0:31:43,490 --> 0:31:45,650
I have to use Skeleton Fire on you

548
0:31:46,560 --> 0:31:49,320
You gonna burn me again!

549
0:31:49,590 --> 0:31:51,080
Why?

550
0:31:51,630 --> 0:31:52,720
Did I make a mistake?

551
0:31:53,030 --> 0:31:55,080
Why?

552
0:31:57,730 --> 0:31:59,320
Why did you use flame bomb to burn me?

553
0:31:59,530 --> 0:32:00,820
Why did you shave off your beard?

554
0:32:00,860 --> 0:32:02,220
You're just another guy

555
0:32:02,490 --> 0:32:03,080
without the beard

556
0:32:03,260 --> 0:32:04,190
Really?

557
0:32:04,630 --> 0:32:05,920
You can't do anything

558
0:32:06,260 --> 0:32:08,350
Do you want to be a scholar instead of a robber?

559
0:32:08,760 --> 0:32:09,920
I've thought about this

560
0:32:10,130 --> 0:32:11,720
Please stop changing image

561
0:32:11,930 --> 0:32:13,890
being a robber is

562
0:32:14,160 --> 0:32:15,020
a good job

563
0:32:15,690 --> 0:32:16,520
I know

564
0:32:16,760 --> 0:32:18,660
I'll try my best!

565
0:32:18,860 --> 0:32:20,490
You look like that thing!

566
0:32:22,230 --> 0:32:23,190
So pathetic

567
0:32:24,330 --> 0:32:26,880
Jing Jing loves my violent side

568
0:32:32,430 --> 0:32:35,880
Having the personality again

569
0:32:53,030 --> 0:32:54,620
Monkey King, come out!

570
0:32:55,660 --> 0:32:56,850
Damn monkey

571
0:32:57,090 --> 0:32:59,120
You said you would marry me when I was 18

572
0:32:59,330 --> 0:33:00,380
I have waited for you 3 years

573
0:33:00,590 --> 0:33:01,650
You come out!

574
0:33:02,230 --> 0:33:04,060
Our King is not here

575
0:33:04,260 --> 0:33:07,020
He said give it Miss Pak when you come here

576
0:33:07,230 --> 0:33:09,060
and thanked Miss Pak very much

577
0:33:09,290 --> 0:33:11,120
He can't enjoy it

578
0:33:20,590 --> 0:33:22,680
500 years...

579
0:33:22,890 --> 0:33:25,420
We've found the Longevity Monk at last

580
0:33:32,390 --> 0:33:34,330
The hair on the sole has shaved off

581
0:33:34,560 --> 0:33:37,080
I don't know when it will grow again

582
0:33:45,490 --> 0:33:49,290
Shit! They come first!

583
0:33:49,660 --> 0:33:52,020
I have to inform

584
0:33:52,360 --> 0:33:53,720
these innocent people

585
0:34:15,990 --> 0:34:18,750
You come back to Waterfall Cave again?

586
0:34:18,960 --> 0:34:19,980
Waterfall Cave?

587
0:34:20,290 --> 0:34:21,090
Who are you?

588
0:34:21,390 --> 0:34:22,720
Why do you bring me here?

589
0:34:23,230 --> 0:34:27,120
No one brings you here You come here on your own

590
0:34:27,590 --> 0:34:31,050
it is normal to miss your home

591
0:34:31,860 --> 0:34:32,850
Don't tease me!

592
0:34:33,130 --> 0:34:36,020
My home is at Mt Wuyue

593
0:34:36,230 --> 0:34:37,490
You have made a mistake can you hear me?

594
0:34:37,760 --> 0:34:40,590
Don't annoy me, please!

595
0:34:43,330 --> 0:34:45,880
We have to go, Master, or we'll be late

596
0:34:46,130 --> 0:34:46,720
Go? What do you wanna do?

597
0:34:46,930 --> 0:34:48,120
Robbery!

598
0:34:48,330 --> 0:34:49,020
Who dare to do so?

599
0:34:49,290 --> 0:34:50,380
We go to rob!

600
0:34:50,590 --> 0:34:51,890
Ok, that's fine!

601
0:34:56,090 --> 0:35:01,490
Go to rob...

602
0:35:03,290 --> 0:35:04,050
What?

603
0:35:04,260 --> 0:35:05,190
Rob the sole

604
0:35:05,390 --> 0:35:06,790
I have no legs. What to do?

605
0:35:12,890 --> 0:35:14,090
What are you looking at?

606
0:35:14,360 --> 0:35:16,480
Are you jealous of my handsomely shaved face?

607
0:35:16,860 --> 0:35:18,050
That's fine

608
0:35:18,260 --> 0:35:19,280
Yes...

609
0:35:19,530 --> 0:35:20,620
Jealous! You guys...

610
0:35:20,890 --> 0:35:22,020
Shut up!

611
0:35:23,790 --> 0:35:26,280
Grapes?

612
0:35:32,160 --> 0:35:33,720
Master, the grapes are washed

613
0:35:33,760 --> 0:35:34,280
Go out

614
0:35:34,590 --> 0:35:35,080
The dinner is ready

615
0:35:35,130 --> 0:35:36,180
Go out!

616
0:35:39,760 --> 0:35:40,820
Who?

617
0:35:44,090 --> 0:35:46,350
I'm the grapes that you bring here!

618
0:35:46,930 --> 0:35:48,020
You're grapes?

619
0:35:49,130 --> 0:35:51,320
No, I'm Grandma Ada?

620
0:35:51,860 --> 0:35:52,920
What Grandma Ada?

621
0:35:53,930 --> 0:35:54,910
Stop the non-sense

622
0:35:55,160 --> 0:35:56,750
I'm Grandpa Buddha, an immortal

623
0:35:56,960 --> 0:35:58,690
I turned myself into grapes and save you

624
0:35:59,490 --> 0:36:02,790
You stole my grapes and forbid me mentioning Grandma

625
0:36:02,990 --> 0:36:04,890
Both women are devils

626
0:36:05,360 --> 0:36:06,480
If you don't believe me

627
0:36:06,730 --> 0:36:08,920
you can use my Magic Mirror!

628
0:36:09,160 --> 0:36:10,490
I use your Mom's mirror!

629
0:36:10,760 --> 0:36:11,490
Say! Listen to me

630
0:36:11,730 --> 0:36:12,520
Have you stolen my grapes?

631
0:36:12,760 --> 0:36:13,620
No!

632
0:36:13,830 --> 0:36:15,260
Where are my grapes!

633
0:36:15,460 --> 0:36:16,050
I'm your grapes!

634
0:36:16,290 --> 0:36:17,320
Louder!

635
0:36:17,660 --> 0:36:18,990
I'm your grapes

636
0:36:19,260 --> 0:36:22,120
Why aren't you an apple?

637
0:36:22,460 --> 0:36:23,620
Listen to me

638
0:36:24,060 --> 0:36:25,250
You shouldn't think I can't defeat you

639
0:36:25,560 --> 0:36:27,080
I don't wanna hurt innocent people

640
0:36:27,330 --> 0:36:28,290
Go out!

641
0:36:28,530 --> 0:36:29,820
You will be seriously hurt!

642
0:36:32,490 --> 0:36:33,580
Jing Jing!

643
0:36:33,860 --> 0:36:34,720
Your beard looks great!

644
0:36:34,930 --> 0:36:36,020
Really?

645
0:36:36,490 --> 0:36:37,790
Why was it so noisy?

646
0:36:38,260 --> 0:36:40,160
Just beating the grapes

647
0:36:42,290 --> 0:36:44,880
Who're gonna beat grapes?

648
0:36:45,560 --> 0:36:47,050
Meal time

649
0:36:47,830 --> 0:36:49,050
Meal time

650
0:36:49,330 --> 0:36:49,980
That's great!

651
0:36:50,260 --> 0:36:50,950
Great?

652
0:36:51,230 --> 0:36:53,390
What a pretty moon. Let'...

653
0:36:54,990 --> 0:36:57,020
Moon? I can't see it

654
0:36:57,290 --> 0:36:59,990
There is a big moon. Can you see it?

655
0:37:00,260 --> 0:37:02,350
It's not dark yet how come is there a moon?

656
0:37:02,590 --> 0:37:03,650
Tell me...

657
0:37:07,430 --> 0:37:10,260
Who? Who the hell...!

658
0:37:10,460 --> 0:37:11,580
Who the hell?

659
0:37:11,830 --> 0:37:12,620
I was turned into grapes

660
0:37:12,790 --> 0:37:13,490
Where are you?

661
0:37:13,690 --> 0:37:14,750
In your trousers

662
0:37:15,860 --> 0:37:17,160
Big grapes!

663
0:37:17,360 --> 0:37:19,220
It's yours. I'm at your back!

664
0:37:20,130 --> 0:37:21,460
That's great to see you

665
0:37:21,730 --> 0:37:22,350
You trust me now!

666
0:37:22,560 --> 0:37:23,750
Yes, I trust you

667
0:37:24,590 --> 0:37:26,490
Why do we have devil here?

668
0:37:26,730 --> 0:37:30,090
Stupid fool, listen to me

669
0:37:30,260 --> 0:37:34,280
These devils are waiting for the Longevity Monk

670
0:37:34,460 --> 0:37:36,220
Longevity Monk?

671
0:37:38,530 --> 0:37:41,920
500 years ago Monkey King was destroyed by Goddess

672
0:37:42,160 --> 0:37:43,890
His master Longevity Monk wanted to save him

673
0:37:44,190 --> 0:37:45,020
He exchanged the monkey's life

674
0:37:45,290 --> 0:37:47,690
with his own

675
0:37:47,930 --> 0:37:49,890
He hoped this monkey would be good

676
0:37:50,060 --> 0:37:51,620
Why does the Longevity Monk

677
0:37:51,890 --> 0:37:52,880
need to appear?

678
0:37:53,960 --> 0:37:57,220
he wanted to save the whole world

679
0:37:57,430 --> 0:37:59,860
so he went to India and tried to get scriptures

680
0:38:00,060 --> 0:38:02,420
he hoped they would do good to the people

681
0:38:02,660 --> 0:38:05,720
All devils were impressed by his spirit

682
0:38:05,990 --> 0:38:07,550
heaven Emperor saw that

683
0:38:07,760 --> 0:38:09,750
He gave the monkey a chance to revive

684
0:38:09,960 --> 0:38:11,890
He planned the master and the disciple to meet here

685
0:38:12,130 --> 0:38:14,490
Then they can finish the journey to the west

686
0:38:15,260 --> 0:38:17,120
Now, you know why there are so many devils here

687
0:38:17,160 --> 0:38:18,590
You got it

688
0:38:20,460 --> 0:38:22,690
So I am having the same

689
0:38:22,730 --> 0:38:23,990
dream

690
0:38:24,230 --> 0:38:27,520
In a pitch-dark area

691
0:38:27,730 --> 0:38:30,250
a pair of seductive eyes

692
0:38:30,530 --> 0:38:31,990
Iooking at me

693
0:38:32,390 --> 0:38:34,420
make me embarrassed

694
0:38:34,690 --> 0:38:35,750
Your eyes look like the eyes in my dream

695
0:38:35,990 --> 0:38:37,960
Sometimes, my face becomes red

696
0:38:38,190 --> 0:38:40,130
I have to face the devils tonight!

697
0:38:40,330 --> 0:38:43,050
Yes! You are facing devils tonight!

698
0:38:43,290 --> 0:38:45,280
Two Magic Bags here and some invisible stickers

699
0:38:45,530 --> 0:38:47,650
You're invisible if you stick one on your body

700
0:38:47,860 --> 0:38:50,090
Cover him by it when he is not aware

701
0:38:50,260 --> 0:38:52,050
I'll cover you up from the back

702
0:38:52,490 --> 0:38:54,290
This is my line!

703
0:38:54,490 --> 0:38:55,420
Whom are you talking to?

704
0:38:55,690 --> 0:38:56,750
To him

705
0:38:57,790 --> 0:39:00,990
Let me help you!

706
0:39:01,390 --> 0:39:03,150
That's great! You're my good bro

707
0:39:03,360 --> 0:39:04,690
Tell all bros to come in

708
0:39:04,930 --> 0:39:05,760
give a magic sticker to each of them

709
0:39:05,890 --> 0:39:07,450
I go back to get the Magic Bag

710
0:39:07,760 --> 0:39:08,690
Then we can catch all the devils

711
0:39:08,730 --> 0:39:09,690
No problem

712
0:39:09,890 --> 0:39:10,860
Good brother

713
0:39:13,530 --> 0:39:14,790
Your eyes today...

714
0:39:14,830 --> 0:39:15,590
Are they seductive?

715
0:39:15,630 --> 0:39:16,680
Yes

716
0:39:21,690 --> 0:39:23,750
I will help you

717
0:39:37,890 --> 0:39:39,650
Help yourself!

718
0:39:40,560 --> 0:39:41,550
What to do?

719
0:39:41,830 --> 0:39:43,160
It is Master's order

720
0:39:43,430 --> 0:39:44,410
You wait a moment

721
0:39:44,760 --> 0:39:45,730
Asst. Master

722
0:39:49,060 --> 0:39:50,390
Tell the others, Master is looking for us

723
0:39:50,430 --> 0:39:51,410
Go

724
0:39:57,590 --> 0:39:59,390
Invisible sticker

725
0:39:59,730 --> 0:40:01,590
Go...

726
0:40:06,560 --> 0:40:07,460
Sister

727
0:40:07,660 --> 0:40:08,590
OK...

728
0:40:08,790 --> 0:40:10,550
Let's keep quiet and see what they want

729
0:40:23,630 --> 0:40:25,220
Sister, drink!

730
0:40:39,530 --> 0:40:41,050
Sister, you drink too

731
0:40:47,760 --> 0:40:48,780
What are you doing?

732
0:40:49,760 --> 0:40:52,090
I'm drunk. I wanna sleep

733
0:40:52,760 --> 0:40:54,490
don't be afraid. We're invisible

734
0:40:54,690 --> 0:40:57,280
You shouldn't drink so much if you cannot drink

735
0:41:17,630 --> 0:41:19,060
We're invisible

736
0:41:19,460 --> 0:41:20,480
You can see nothing all the time

737
0:41:20,730 --> 0:41:21,590
Ok!

738
0:41:26,190 --> 0:41:27,750
Master hasn't come yet

739
0:41:27,990 --> 0:41:28,920
Yes

740
0:41:29,160 --> 0:41:30,350
You say there is roast chicken

741
0:41:40,190 --> 0:41:42,620
Master! It's burning

742
0:41:43,830 --> 0:41:44,810
Don't be naked

743
0:42:34,960 --> 0:42:36,420
Pay me back! Fool!

744
0:42:36,630 --> 0:42:37,780
No need to be like that?

745
0:42:37,990 --> 0:42:39,580
None of your business, pay me back

746
0:42:39,790 --> 0:42:40,620
When did I borrow money from you

747
0:42:40,860 --> 0:42:41,590
You owe me

748
0:42:42,060 --> 0:42:42,960
I owe you?

749
0:42:43,160 --> 0:42:43,780
Don't you remember?

750
0:42:44,090 --> 0:42:45,080
No...

751
0:42:46,390 --> 0:42:47,320
You lost your memory

752
0:42:47,630 --> 0:42:48,850
Sorry

753
0:43:10,360 --> 0:43:11,880
You should pay back!

754
0:43:12,060 --> 0:43:13,420
/No need to be like that

755
0:43:13,630 --> 0:43:14,520
Pay me back, or I'll ruin your face

756
0:43:14,930 --> 0:43:16,550
I have paid you back last month

757
0:43:16,790 --> 0:43:19,490
Really? Yes, yes

758
0:43:19,990 --> 0:43:22,150
You're old. You lost your memory

759
0:43:22,430 --> 0:43:25,050
Forget it, it's my fault

760
0:43:26,070 --> 0:43:28,120
Cut it! Cut it!

761
0:43:28,870 --> 0:43:31,700
That's better than nothing

762
0:43:31,930 --> 0:43:32,990
Fight with him! Bros!

763
0:43:33,330 --> 0:43:34,090
Bros, let's go!

764
0:43:34,130 --> 0:43:35,260
Yes!

765
0:43:38,460 --> 0:43:40,120
Devils, come out!

766
0:43:42,930 --> 0:43:44,330
Where is the Magic Bag?

767
0:43:44,830 --> 0:43:48,290
The Magic Bag is here They wanna frame you

768
0:43:49,100 --> 0:43:51,460
Traitor, you betray me

769
0:43:54,830 --> 0:43:56,490
Today, you betray me

770
0:43:56,730 --> 0:43:58,060
I will betray you one day

771
0:43:58,260 --> 0:43:59,420
Really?

772
0:43:59,660 --> 0:44:00,930
Yes!

773
0:44:04,630 --> 0:44:06,690
I want to destroy all devils

774
0:44:06,970 --> 0:44:08,190
I can take off my underwear!

775
0:44:12,070 --> 0:44:15,160
Master, there's really something wrong with Asst. Master

776
0:44:15,330 --> 0:44:17,320
That guy is unwilling to do anything even if I beg him

777
0:44:17,560 --> 0:44:19,430
Now, he admit so quickly There must be something wrong

778
0:44:19,660 --> 0:44:20,320
Pull him out

779
0:44:20,360 --> 0:44:21,660
Yes!

780
0:44:23,600 --> 0:44:24,530
Let me go...

781
0:44:25,730 --> 0:44:26,700
Let me go

782
0:44:26,930 --> 0:44:27,830
Shut up

783
0:44:28,230 --> 0:44:30,220
Let me go

784
0:44:30,430 --> 0:44:31,760
Kneel down

785
0:44:32,130 --> 0:44:35,460
You son of a bitch I'm gonna kill you tonight

786
0:44:35,730 --> 0:44:36,660
Fine!

787
0:44:37,260 --> 0:44:38,560
You can't blame him

788
0:44:38,830 --> 0:44:41,520
He's only mesmerized by both devils

789
0:44:42,930 --> 0:44:43,660
Let me go

790
0:44:43,930 --> 0:44:45,060
or I'll tell my Master to kill you

791
0:44:45,600 --> 0:44:46,790
Shut up!

792
0:44:49,330 --> 0:44:50,230
Wong Choi

793
0:44:50,770 --> 0:44:53,230
The string you're biting is so familiar

794
0:44:53,260 --> 0:44:53,960
Stranger

795
0:44:54,200 --> 0:44:56,530
It is the string for my Magic Bag

796
0:44:59,700 --> 0:45:00,600
Son of a bitch

797
0:45:00,830 --> 0:45:03,520
How dare you come here!

798
0:45:05,500 --> 0:45:06,460
Come here!

799
0:45:06,770 --> 0:45:08,750
I'll kill you, reincarnated Monkey King

800
0:45:08,970 --> 0:45:11,120
Then you won't find the Longevity Monk

801
0:45:11,430 --> 0:45:12,230
What?

802
0:45:12,730 --> 0:45:13,720
He is the Monkey King?

803
0:45:15,230 --> 0:45:16,420
Say you're the Monkey King

804
0:45:16,700 --> 0:45:18,220
or we'll all die

805
0:45:18,430 --> 0:45:19,420
He's not the Monkey King

806
0:45:19,660 --> 0:45:20,960
He can't even withstand my Skeleton Fire

807
0:45:21,170 --> 0:45:22,130
He is not the Monkey King?

808
0:45:22,500 --> 0:45:23,430
Shit!

809
0:45:23,660 --> 0:45:24,990
You've exposed a top secret

810
0:45:25,230 --> 0:45:25,960
Really?

811
0:45:26,000 --> 0:45:27,330
This way

812
0:45:27,730 --> 0:45:29,220
Are you really a fairy?

813
0:45:29,460 --> 0:45:30,560
Give me your hand

814
0:45:31,070 --> 0:45:32,860
It is too much of you...

815
0:45:33,530 --> 0:45:35,290
Do you think I can't withstand your Skeleton Fire?

816
0:45:35,530 --> 0:45:37,000
Burn me again

817
0:45:37,260 --> 0:45:37,920
Serious?

818
0:45:38,430 --> 0:45:39,360
Great!

819
0:45:42,100 --> 0:45:44,190
I'm not scared! See?

820
0:45:44,500 --> 0:45:45,860
Yes!

821
0:45:50,330 --> 0:45:52,890
You can burn my hand if you like

822
0:45:53,400 --> 0:45:55,420
I'm not afraid of you

823
0:45:56,460 --> 0:45:58,360
Not burn my hand?

824
0:46:05,360 --> 0:46:06,520
Burning

825
0:46:10,130 --> 0:46:11,830
The hand is still OK

826
0:46:13,530 --> 0:46:14,590
Let go!

827
0:46:15,260 --> 0:46:16,750
Now you know I'm great

828
0:46:17,000 --> 0:46:17,830
Surrender!

829
0:46:18,070 --> 0:46:19,960
I have got my bros and a fairy

830
0:46:20,260 --> 0:46:21,090
Where are you going?

831
0:46:21,360 --> 0:46:22,890
I'll take revenge on you one day

832
0:46:23,260 --> 0:46:24,730
Even a fairy is not righteous

833
0:46:25,000 --> 0:46:25,690
No need to ask

834
0:46:25,900 --> 0:46:27,830
My bros must be there

835
0:46:28,260 --> 0:46:29,750
Yes! Master!

836
0:46:30,500 --> 0:46:32,790
Sons of bitches!

837
0:46:33,600 --> 0:46:35,000
Are you that heartless guy?

838
0:46:35,200 --> 0:46:36,560
You deceived me last night!

839
0:46:37,870 --> 0:46:39,130
That Monkey King

840
0:46:39,500 --> 0:46:41,260
Sister will not be married just because of you

841
0:46:41,630 --> 0:46:42,530
Me?

842
0:46:44,930 --> 0:46:45,950
Get the Joker!

843
0:46:46,130 --> 0:46:47,120
Go!

844
0:46:47,330 --> 0:46:48,300
Stop that

845
0:46:48,560 --> 0:46:50,120
Master, go

846
0:46:59,230 --> 0:47:01,200
Don't kill my bros!

847
0:47:23,030 --> 0:47:24,660
Master

848
0:47:31,430 --> 0:47:32,990
Blindy, I'm here, no need to scare

849
0:47:36,460 --> 0:47:37,190
Sorry, Blindy!

850
0:47:37,430 --> 0:47:38,330
You have made a mistake

851
0:47:38,630 --> 0:47:39,890
You won't blame me, will you?

852
0:47:41,200 --> 0:47:43,190
For my whole life I know

853
0:47:43,500 --> 0:47:45,090
I'm blind...

854
0:47:45,970 --> 0:47:50,020
But I am right to be your follower!

855
0:47:53,400 --> 0:47:55,130
Kill you!

856
0:47:59,160 --> 0:48:00,150
You go to hell

857
0:48:00,400 --> 0:48:01,330
You can't kill him

858
0:48:01,530 --> 0:48:02,390
You still help him

859
0:48:02,630 --> 0:48:03,430
You want to rely on him to find the Longevity Monk

860
0:48:04,300 --> 0:48:05,290
Take him back to Spider's Web Cave

861
0:48:09,460 --> 0:48:10,520
Sister

862
0:48:11,330 --> 0:48:14,630
Only one man can be benefit by it

863
0:48:14,900 --> 0:48:16,660
You don't know this in fact

864
0:48:17,260 --> 0:48:19,250
You won't gian anything even if you hurt me

865
0:48:19,460 --> 0:48:20,590
Look at your palm

866
0:48:22,330 --> 0:48:23,350
Black Widow!

867
0:48:25,000 --> 0:48:26,730
You've been poisoned by my weapon

868
0:48:26,970 --> 0:48:28,430
You will die in 7 days

869
0:48:28,660 --> 0:48:30,290
if you can't get my remedy

870
0:48:31,360 --> 0:48:32,850
Sister, I don't dare to do so anymore

871
0:48:33,160 --> 0:48:34,100
Get lost!

872
0:48:37,900 --> 0:48:39,800
You regret at last

873
0:48:40,000 --> 0:48:42,330
No! A fierce thing has come

874
0:48:44,200 --> 0:48:45,090
Go out and have a look

875
0:48:47,160 --> 0:48:48,060
Where are you going?

876
0:48:48,300 --> 0:48:49,490
No!...

877
0:48:53,630 --> 0:48:54,150
King Bull has come?

878
0:48:54,200 --> 0:48:55,460
King Bull?

879
0:49:04,900 --> 0:49:05,950
Pretend to be dead here?

880
0:49:06,200 --> 0:49:06,790
Me too...

881
0:49:09,960 --> 0:49:11,090
Monster

882
0:49:21,430 --> 0:49:22,730
Granpa Buddha

883
0:49:23,330 --> 0:49:24,890
Give the Longevity Monk to me

884
0:49:25,130 --> 0:49:25,990
or you're gonna die

885
0:49:26,230 --> 0:49:26,960
We have nothing to talk

886
0:49:27,130 --> 0:49:28,500
You are looking for the Monkey King

887
0:49:29,160 --> 0:49:30,990
My bro Monkey King?

888
0:49:31,360 --> 0:49:32,490
Where is he?

889
0:49:33,660 --> 0:49:34,560
This monster

890
0:49:34,870 --> 0:49:35,990
is the Monkey King's Bro

891
0:49:36,260 --> 0:49:37,290
We are saved

892
0:49:37,700 --> 0:49:39,360
I'm you Bro

893
0:49:39,630 --> 0:49:40,890
the reincamated Monkey King

894
0:49:41,730 --> 0:49:42,660
You?

895
0:49:42,900 --> 0:49:43,690
Yes...

896
0:49:43,930 --> 0:49:44,860
Yes! It's me

897
0:49:45,060 --> 0:49:47,360
I'm gonna kill you adulterer!

898
0:49:51,730 --> 0:49:53,860
Tell me your name, witch!

899
0:49:54,630 --> 0:49:55,530
I'm Boney M of Spider Devil

900
0:49:55,560 --> 0:49:56,860
Spider Woman

901
0:49:57,160 --> 0:49:59,990
In the old days when I know your masters

902
0:50:00,300 --> 0:50:02,490
where were you?

903
0:50:02,870 --> 0:50:04,890
I have no business with you...

904
0:50:05,200 --> 0:50:06,190
Change...

905
0:50:10,030 --> 0:50:12,290
I'm going to kill

906
0:50:12,600 --> 0:50:13,720
the ones who black my way

907
0:50:14,400 --> 0:50:15,730
Try my White Bone Whip!

908
0:50:39,330 --> 0:50:40,020
Change!

909
0:50:41,600 --> 0:50:42,760
Dragon Heavenly Silk!

910
0:50:54,430 --> 0:50:55,800
Go!

911
0:50:57,000 --> 0:50:58,490
It's only small trick

912
0:51:42,730 --> 0:51:44,360
Blindy, you're still alive!

913
0:51:45,030 --> 0:51:47,000
We are in trouble

914
0:51:47,460 --> 0:51:48,590
I admire you

915
0:51:51,330 --> 0:51:53,190
Don't go...

916
0:51:54,560 --> 0:51:56,690
Let me see what magic you have got

917
0:51:57,400 --> 0:51:58,490
King Bull Go

918
0:52:08,500 --> 0:52:09,760
My Little Buddha in hurt

919
0:52:09,930 --> 0:52:11,900
Another hundred years before it is healed

920
0:52:15,760 --> 0:52:17,490
Get up

921
0:52:22,100 --> 0:52:23,120
What are you doing?

922
0:52:25,130 --> 0:52:26,930
Master wanna see you

923
0:52:27,860 --> 0:52:28,990
What place is this?

924
0:52:29,300 --> 0:52:30,290
Spider Web Cave

925
0:52:31,960 --> 0:52:33,090
Spider Web Cave?

926
0:52:33,300 --> 0:52:34,190
Yes!

927
0:52:34,400 --> 0:52:36,830
I'm Spider Devil's disciple Spider Woman

928
0:52:37,060 --> 0:52:38,430
This is Spider Web Cave

929
0:52:39,060 --> 0:52:40,930
Spider Web Cave?

930
0:52:41,300 --> 0:52:42,490
Let's go! Monkey

931
0:52:42,730 --> 0:52:43,750
Hey, you have gone mad

932
0:52:43,960 --> 0:52:45,930
I'm your Master, monkey!

933
0:52:46,130 --> 0:52:46,930
I'm mad

934
0:52:47,130 --> 0:52:48,290
You are lying!

935
0:52:48,600 --> 0:52:49,690
You've admitted that

936
0:52:49,930 --> 0:52:50,830
you're the Monkey King

937
0:52:51,030 --> 0:52:51,660
Go!

938
0:52:51,960 --> 0:52:52,590
Get smart just for once

939
0:52:52,830 --> 0:52:53,850
I was forced to pretend

940
0:52:54,060 --> 0:52:56,290
you can use the Magic Mirror to show my true identity

941
0:52:57,000 --> 0:52:58,090
Magic Mirror?

942
0:53:05,500 --> 0:53:07,730
Can you see it?

943
0:53:07,960 --> 0:53:08,830
Yes

944
0:53:09,130 --> 0:53:10,120
Clear?

945
0:53:11,600 --> 0:53:12,690
Deceive me!

946
0:53:12,930 --> 0:53:14,690
This is not the Magic Mirror

947
0:53:15,660 --> 0:53:17,650
Pig!

948
0:53:18,630 --> 0:53:20,530
Sister, have pity on me

949
0:53:21,400 --> 0:53:22,490
Stay calm

950
0:53:23,030 --> 0:53:25,330
I guarantee that you can trust

951
0:53:25,600 --> 0:53:26,720
my word this time

952
0:53:27,160 --> 0:53:27,820
Master!

953
0:53:28,130 --> 0:53:28,790
Master!

954
0:53:29,030 --> 0:53:30,620
Master! The monkey has come

955
0:53:31,760 --> 0:53:34,420
Where is the Longevity Monk?

956
0:53:36,560 --> 0:53:38,690
Big misunderstanding, everybody

957
0:53:39,030 --> 0:53:40,050
How big?

958
0:53:40,360 --> 0:53:41,330
Let me tell you secretly

959
0:53:41,660 --> 0:53:43,600
I was born in the Year of Monkey but I'm not the Monkey King

960
0:53:43,960 --> 0:53:44,560
A waste of time!

961
0:53:44,830 --> 0:53:45,420
I have got the Magic Mirror and everything

962
0:53:45,700 --> 0:53:46,430
You can use the mirror on me

963
0:53:46,660 --> 0:53:47,460
Fake mirror

964
0:53:47,700 --> 0:53:48,360
how dare you use the fake mirror...

965
0:53:48,600 --> 0:53:49,890
Now! Stop playing game

966
0:53:50,630 --> 0:53:51,890
If I'm the Monkey King

967
0:53:52,160 --> 0:53:53,290
why am I standing here for you to bite my hand?

968
0:53:53,560 --> 0:53:54,290
I could jump to the sky

969
0:53:54,530 --> 0:53:56,620
Then shit on your heads

970
0:53:56,860 --> 0:53:57,760
You haven't changed to be Monkey King yet

971
0:53:58,030 --> 0:53:59,660
You'll shit at that time

972
0:53:59,860 --> 0:54:01,690
What is it, sister?

973
0:54:02,700 --> 0:54:03,790
Broken hearted?

974
0:54:04,460 --> 0:54:05,190
No

975
0:54:05,460 --> 0:54:06,590
No?

976
0:54:08,300 --> 0:54:10,660
I won't be hurt by this man again

977
0:54:12,200 --> 0:54:13,290
you are lying to me!

978
0:54:14,330 --> 0:54:16,230
Sister, I'm not lying to you

979
0:54:17,030 --> 0:54:19,190
Then kill him

980
0:54:19,660 --> 0:54:20,920
Kill him

981
0:54:21,630 --> 0:54:23,150
Don't you want to find the Longevity Monk?

982
0:54:23,830 --> 0:54:26,490
Yes! But I don't think you will kill him

983
0:54:31,960 --> 0:54:33,790
Not accurate...

984
0:54:34,030 --> 0:54:35,120
Give the sword!

985
0:54:37,200 --> 0:54:39,030
Give! Understand

986
0:54:41,760 --> 0:54:42,630
Kill him!

987
0:54:43,300 --> 0:54:44,420
You've sliced a piece of my thigh out

988
0:54:44,660 --> 0:54:45,390
I intended to do that

989
0:54:45,630 --> 0:54:46,720
Give me a bill and I'll pay you back

990
0:54:46,930 --> 0:54:47,760
You're welcome

991
0:54:48,230 --> 0:54:49,360
I kill you!

992
0:54:52,760 --> 0:54:55,750
Cheap whore, you still love that monkey

993
0:54:55,960 --> 0:54:57,490
Stop that, I'm gonna kill you

994
0:55:13,530 --> 0:55:14,590
Are you Ok?

995
0:55:19,530 --> 0:55:22,360
You're still concerned about me

996
0:55:22,800 --> 0:55:26,030
I'm gonna love forever onwards

997
0:55:32,030 --> 0:55:33,220
They are outside

998
0:55:33,430 --> 0:55:34,520
Can this door block them?

999
0:55:34,760 --> 0:55:36,960
this door is mad of unbreakable steel

1000
0:55:40,300 --> 0:55:41,350
Stand aside

1001
0:55:44,560 --> 0:55:47,220
Sister, do you remember how he treated you in the past?

1002
0:55:47,760 --> 0:55:49,560
He deceived you, refused to marry you

1003
0:55:49,800 --> 0:55:51,560
You had a good marriage with Chilian Immortal

1004
0:55:51,800 --> 0:55:52,760
He ruined it

1005
0:55:53,030 --> 0:55:53,930
He can do nothing now

1006
0:55:54,130 --> 0:55:54,930
When he returned to his own image

1007
0:55:55,200 --> 0:55:56,090
he'll leave you

1008
0:55:56,330 --> 0:55:57,320
Have you finished? Son of bitch!

1009
0:55:57,630 --> 0:55:59,150
Damn monkey how dare you call me a bitch!

1010
0:55:59,430 --> 0:56:00,690
Scold me, son of a bitch

1011
0:56:01,300 --> 0:56:03,230
Don't think it's safe to hide inside

1012
0:56:03,430 --> 0:56:04,900
it's full moon tonight

1013
0:56:05,160 --> 0:56:06,630
She will become a zombie!

1014
0:56:10,330 --> 0:56:12,090
I don't scare, son of a bitch

1015
0:56:18,930 --> 0:56:19,900
What?

1016
0:56:20,200 --> 0:56:22,720
There are many hills and caves here

1017
0:56:22,960 --> 0:56:24,550
We don't know where the Spider Web Cave is?

1018
0:56:24,600 --> 0:56:25,930
Yes...

1019
0:56:26,130 --> 0:56:29,790
More than the bugs in my body. Search!

1020
0:57:01,000 --> 0:57:02,790
What are you doing?

1021
0:57:03,230 --> 0:57:05,750
How about inside? Are you fine?

1022
0:57:06,060 --> 0:57:07,390
Of course I'm alright

1023
0:57:07,630 --> 0:57:09,060
We are very happy

1024
0:57:10,900 --> 0:57:12,660
Jing Jing is till very pretty

1025
0:57:12,900 --> 0:57:14,490
I'm still very handsome

1026
0:57:14,700 --> 0:57:15,920
We are still very good-looking

1027
0:57:16,200 --> 0:57:17,490
Meal time, Ma'am 30th

1028
0:57:22,000 --> 0:57:23,620
Help...

1029
0:57:24,200 --> 0:57:25,250
Zombie!

1030
0:57:25,430 --> 0:57:26,090
Open the door!

1031
0:57:26,360 --> 0:57:26,850
I can't open it!

1032
0:57:27,200 --> 0:57:28,160
Kiss her, breath life to her

1033
0:57:28,760 --> 0:57:30,490
Maybe it will be stopped

1034
0:57:32,660 --> 0:57:33,820
Scare me!

1035
0:57:35,260 --> 0:57:37,200
Sister, you can't defeat me

1036
0:57:37,360 --> 0:57:38,300
Really?

1037
0:57:39,260 --> 0:57:41,420
I'll break you neck if you move

1038
0:57:43,100 --> 0:57:45,030
Give me the key! Lock him up

1039
0:57:46,160 --> 0:57:47,890
You wanna go inside

1040
0:57:47,930 --> 0:57:48,860
Now you can go

1041
0:57:51,300 --> 0:57:52,590
Goodbye!

1042
0:58:06,930 --> 0:58:09,490
Please stop taking revenge

1043
0:58:12,560 --> 0:58:14,120
Listen to my suggestions

1044
0:58:15,100 --> 0:58:16,930
You can beat me but please don't hit my face...

1045
0:58:21,100 --> 0:58:23,090
Stop beat my cock, thanks

1046
0:58:23,460 --> 0:58:25,090
There is a chicken, Ma'am 30th

1047
0:58:30,300 --> 0:58:31,290
I'm telling you

1048
0:58:40,960 --> 0:58:42,900
No reactions after a kiss

1049
0:58:43,160 --> 0:58:44,030
Don't lock it up

1050
0:58:47,330 --> 0:58:49,260
Ok, since you refuse to open the door

1051
0:58:49,600 --> 0:58:50,720
I warn you

1052
0:58:51,030 --> 0:58:54,000
I'll rape and kill your lover

1053
0:58:58,100 --> 0:58:58,930
One

1054
0:59:09,160 --> 0:59:09,990
Two

1055
0:59:13,330 --> 0:59:14,690
I get it

1056
0:59:19,330 --> 0:59:20,260
Three

1057
0:59:24,230 --> 0:59:26,030
Seductive magic

1058
0:59:35,560 --> 0:59:36,590
Go!

1059
0:59:45,100 --> 0:59:46,120
What are you doing?

1060
0:59:46,760 --> 0:59:48,350
I have just shivered for a while

1061
0:59:49,100 --> 0:59:50,360
Very interesting

1062
0:59:50,660 --> 0:59:52,190
You shivered on my body?

1063
0:59:52,900 --> 0:59:53,920
Yes

1064
0:59:55,460 --> 0:59:56,790
Oh god!

1065
1:00:20,130 --> 1:00:22,320
It must be better if she's not a devil!

1066
1:00:31,830 --> 1:00:33,420
You're poisoned

1067
1:00:34,930 --> 1:00:36,860
You'll die if you don't cured

1068
1:00:37,360 --> 1:00:38,490
What for even if I'm cured?

1069
1:00:39,100 --> 1:00:41,530
Living long is meaningless if you are unhappy

1070
1:00:41,900 --> 1:00:45,520
Your last few days will be great if you're happy

1071
1:00:47,230 --> 1:00:48,590
If I tell you I'm the Monkey King

1072
1:00:48,830 --> 1:00:49,820
what do you think?

1073
1:00:50,530 --> 1:00:51,660
I will kill you

1074
1:00:52,530 --> 1:00:53,890
I'm not him

1075
1:00:54,700 --> 1:00:55,790
This is a magic mirror

1076
1:00:56,000 --> 1:00:56,790
You should use it

1077
1:00:57,200 --> 1:00:58,630
You're not him, really?

1078
1:00:59,430 --> 1:01:00,490
I'm not

1079
1:01:01,030 --> 1:01:02,550
Don't you scare that I will kill you?

1080
1:01:03,060 --> 1:01:05,500
Yes, but I have no option

1081
1:01:06,830 --> 1:01:08,960
Because I don't want you to look at me

1082
1:01:09,730 --> 1:01:11,920
while you're thinking of another

1083
1:01:14,330 --> 1:01:15,890
I would like to kill you

1084
1:01:16,730 --> 1:01:19,030
You said living long was meaningless

1085
1:01:19,260 --> 1:01:20,730
if you were unhappy

1086
1:02:12,830 --> 1:02:13,690
Go ahead!

1087
1:02:13,900 --> 1:02:15,060
Yes, I'll

1088
1:02:25,860 --> 1:02:28,130
Shit! Who make this knot?

1089
1:02:28,360 --> 1:02:29,450
Let me do it!

1090
1:02:38,860 --> 1:02:41,330
Sorry, I don't mean it

1091
1:02:41,930 --> 1:02:43,020
You do it strongly

1092
1:02:43,430 --> 1:02:44,660
So I wanna do it with you

1093
1:02:45,130 --> 1:02:46,490
Although I'm not a righteous man

1094
1:02:46,700 --> 1:02:47,960
I won't take advantages from the others

1095
1:02:49,160 --> 1:02:50,320
I'm not used to do it at daytime

1096
1:02:51,230 --> 1:02:52,660
Let's wait till night

1097
1:02:59,360 --> 1:03:01,450
No matter when

1098
1:03:01,900 --> 1:03:03,730
call me if you need me

1099
1:03:04,730 --> 1:03:05,820
From now on

1100
1:03:06,160 --> 1:03:07,790
I'll be with you

1101
1:03:19,330 --> 1:03:19,960
Can you get him?

1102
1:03:20,000 --> 1:03:20,620
No

1103
1:03:20,660 --> 1:03:21,960
Go on

1104
1:03:45,230 --> 1:03:46,960
Damn!

1105
1:03:47,400 --> 1:03:49,830
I'm so pretty

1106
1:03:50,060 --> 1:03:52,860
But I have a baby with such an ugly man

1107
1:03:58,630 --> 1:03:59,620
Ma'am 30th

1108
1:03:59,800 --> 1:04:00,960
Shut up!

1109
1:04:01,660 --> 1:04:03,790
I will kill you if I'm not pregnant

1110
1:04:05,230 --> 1:04:05,920
Thanks

1111
1:04:06,160 --> 1:04:07,320
Why are you so happy?

1112
1:04:08,360 --> 1:04:09,660
Tell you...

1113
1:04:09,900 --> 1:04:10,450
Don't tell the baby

1114
1:04:10,730 --> 1:04:12,990
you're his father

1115
1:04:14,260 --> 1:04:15,320
What should I be?

1116
1:04:15,500 --> 1:04:16,720
His maiden

1117
1:04:16,960 --> 1:04:18,490
I'm a man. I can't be a maiden!

1118
1:04:19,260 --> 1:04:20,350
We bring him up

1119
1:04:20,600 --> 1:04:22,760
He don't know if a maiden is a man or woman

1120
1:04:23,600 --> 1:04:24,650
That's right

1121
1:04:27,760 --> 1:04:30,250
I've found a guy just like you

1122
1:04:42,160 --> 1:04:43,190
It's you?

1123
1:04:45,800 --> 1:04:48,490
Do you wanna know where the Longevity Monk is?

1124
1:04:51,030 --> 1:04:52,020
Yes, I do

1125
1:04:52,660 --> 1:04:54,130
Don't strike back if you do

1126
1:04:57,760 --> 1:05:00,460
you have to pay for the flesh of the Longevity Monk

1127
1:05:00,660 --> 1:05:01,720
It worths!

1128
1:05:04,100 --> 1:05:06,220
If you give me the medication for Jing Jing

1129
1:05:06,500 --> 1:05:07,830
I will tell you where the Longevity Monk is

1130
1:05:08,830 --> 1:05:10,390
You just do it for that bitch

1131
1:05:11,630 --> 1:05:13,760
I like to do so

1132
1:05:19,630 --> 1:05:21,150
Maiden

1133
1:05:23,700 --> 1:05:25,820
Maiden is kissing you

1134
1:05:33,000 --> 1:05:35,120
Ok, let's go by tomorrow

1135
1:05:41,430 --> 1:05:43,400
Because of love

1136
1:05:44,200 --> 1:05:49,650
you can ruin my face if you like

1137
1:05:55,130 --> 1:05:56,620
Hurry up, do you wanna save someone?

1138
1:05:56,860 --> 1:05:57,950
Just let me do it!

1139
1:06:08,630 --> 1:06:09,490
Joker

1140
1:06:09,730 --> 1:06:11,290
Sister can't take this anymore You go ahead!

1141
1:06:11,530 --> 1:06:13,690
Let me...do that

1142
1:06:24,400 --> 1:06:25,490
Not here

1143
1:06:31,960 --> 1:06:33,620
Everyone deceives me

1144
1:06:37,200 --> 1:06:39,990
We'll reach the Buddha Cave after climbing this hill

1145
1:06:42,560 --> 1:06:45,500
No, Ah!

1146
1:06:46,530 --> 1:06:47,960
Jing Jing!

1147
1:06:49,130 --> 1:06:51,360
Jing Jing!

1148
1:06:57,030 --> 1:06:58,890
She thought I left her alone

1149
1:06:59,600 --> 1:07:00,560
How long will you search?

1150
1:07:00,800 --> 1:07:02,020
Jing Jing

1151
1:07:02,300 --> 1:07:03,960
She's poisoned, must have died and fell down from the cliff

1152
1:07:06,500 --> 1:07:08,690
It's all because of you

1153
1:07:08,960 --> 1:07:10,220
You shouldn't let me sleep for a whole night

1154
1:07:10,260 --> 1:07:11,090
I should come here as soon as possible

1155
1:07:11,360 --> 1:07:12,190
You should whip the horse strongly

1156
1:07:12,230 --> 1:07:13,130
We can be faster!

1157
1:07:13,430 --> 1:07:14,490
I won't tell you where the Longevity Monk is

1158
1:07:14,530 --> 1:07:15,660
I don't know anything

1159
1:07:17,000 --> 1:07:18,520
How dare you put the blame on me!

1160
1:07:21,700 --> 1:07:22,460
What?

1161
1:07:22,660 --> 1:07:25,420
We discovered that Boney M fainted under the cliff

1162
1:07:25,630 --> 1:07:27,260
Granpa Buddha has died

1163
1:07:29,300 --> 1:07:30,730
God is helping me!

1164
1:07:33,000 --> 1:07:34,050
Go in!

1165
1:07:35,800 --> 1:07:36,660
If you don't tell me

1166
1:07:36,930 --> 1:07:38,020
you can't go out

1167
1:07:41,400 --> 1:07:42,330
I won't listen to you

1168
1:07:47,800 --> 1:07:51,160
The ground is not so hard

1169
1:07:54,400 --> 1:07:57,120
Powerful devil, extraordinary energy!

1170
1:07:58,700 --> 1:07:59,690
I will cure your wound but

1171
1:07:59,960 --> 1:08:02,490
you must take me to the Cave to get the incarnated monkey

1172
1:08:02,730 --> 1:08:03,850
We'll find the Longevity Monk sooner or later

1173
1:08:04,100 --> 1:08:06,150
You can also eat the flesh of the Longevity Monk

1174
1:08:06,460 --> 1:08:08,790
or you will die painfully

1175
1:08:14,060 --> 1:08:15,690
I have to come out even if I have to dig a tunnel

1176
1:08:20,130 --> 1:08:22,960
I can move freely in time and space with the power of moon

1177
1:08:26,700 --> 1:08:27,920
What is it?

1178
1:08:45,430 --> 1:08:48,060
This is the Indian language

1179
1:08:49,830 --> 1:08:51,730
The Pandora's Box

1180
1:08:54,160 --> 1:08:56,130
The treasure left behind by Spider Web Devil?

1181
1:09:26,060 --> 1:09:27,360
Take me into the Cave

1182
1:09:30,800 --> 1:09:32,060
Why does the belly feel painful?

1183
1:09:32,300 --> 1:09:33,260
Is it coming?

1184
1:09:34,400 --> 1:09:35,620
Where am I?

1185
1:09:35,860 --> 1:09:36,630
Why so many traps?

1186
1:09:36,900 --> 1:09:37,950
It becomes wetter and wetter

1187
1:10:17,860 --> 1:10:20,190
Welcome, our King!

1188
1:10:31,560 --> 1:10:33,030
Damn! I've met a ghost!

1189
1:10:34,830 --> 1:10:37,060
What's going on?

1190
1:10:37,760 --> 1:10:38,750
You love the Longevity Monk

1191
1:10:39,030 --> 1:10:40,720
so I play him to make you happy

1192
1:10:40,960 --> 1:10:41,590
What are you doing?

1193
1:10:41,900 --> 1:10:43,020
I'm helping you to give birth!

1194
1:10:43,960 --> 1:10:45,120
The head is coming out!

1195
1:10:45,700 --> 1:10:46,820
Really, I've no feeling

1196
1:10:46,860 --> 1:10:47,850
You see?

1197
1:10:48,330 --> 1:10:49,460
This is my knee

1198
1:10:49,760 --> 1:10:50,990
So there is no hair

1199
1:10:51,400 --> 1:10:52,230
Someone's coming

1200
1:10:52,430 --> 1:10:54,360
Hide up, be quick

1201
1:10:59,460 --> 1:11:00,450
I'm hurt

1202
1:11:00,760 --> 1:11:01,890
I'm hurt, too

1203
1:11:02,160 --> 1:11:03,960
Please let go of your hand! Alright!

1204
1:11:14,730 --> 1:11:15,890
Goddess

1205
1:11:17,360 --> 1:11:20,020
Monkey King you'd committed serious offences

1206
1:11:20,260 --> 1:11:23,560
I hope you know you're wrong

1207
1:11:23,760 --> 1:11:24,790
Who's talking?

1208
1:11:25,300 --> 1:11:28,590
500 years ago your master Longevity Monk sacrificed

1209
1:11:28,830 --> 1:11:29,990
his life to save you

1210
1:11:30,300 --> 1:11:31,690
Heaven Emperor planned that

1211
1:11:31,960 --> 1:11:33,930
you revive after 500 years

1212
1:11:34,200 --> 1:11:35,890
I hope you'll be like your master

1213
1:11:36,230 --> 1:11:37,320
Making sacrifices to save the others

1214
1:11:37,600 --> 1:11:39,690
To clean the sin that you've made before

1215
1:11:40,000 --> 1:11:42,160
You should put on the Gold Ring on your head

1216
1:11:42,360 --> 1:11:43,590
Admit you sin

1217
1:11:43,830 --> 1:11:46,730
Then you'll become the super Monkey King

1218
1:11:47,130 --> 1:11:49,990
You'll take the responsibility to get scriptures in the west

1219
1:11:50,300 --> 1:11:51,350
Rewrite the history

1220
1:11:51,600 --> 1:11:53,960
All things in human life is then none of your business

1221
1:11:54,160 --> 1:11:56,590
you can't have any desires anymore

1222
1:11:56,800 --> 1:11:58,520
Worship Buddha whole-heartedly

1223
1:11:59,030 --> 1:12:01,590
You haven't turned into the Monkey King

1224
1:12:01,860 --> 1:12:03,090
because you haven't met the guy

1225
1:12:03,130 --> 1:12:04,990
who gives you the 3 birthmarks

1226
1:12:05,260 --> 1:12:06,490
After you see him

1227
1:12:06,730 --> 1:12:08,530
your whole life will be changed

1228
1:12:10,960 --> 1:12:12,330
Talking to me?

1229
1:12:13,000 --> 1:12:14,460
I don't think so

1230
1:12:15,300 --> 1:12:17,520
I think you have made a mistake

1231
1:12:19,330 --> 1:12:20,260
Crazy!

1232
1:12:20,660 --> 1:12:23,130
Painful...

1233
1:12:23,530 --> 1:12:24,620
Let go!

1234
1:12:24,930 --> 1:12:28,690
Keep calm please No

1235
1:12:28,930 --> 1:12:30,360
Keep calm

1236
1:12:30,900 --> 1:12:33,290
I'm painful

1237
1:12:33,600 --> 1:12:34,990
I'm painful, too

1238
1:12:42,200 --> 1:12:43,130
Mind the traps here

1239
1:12:45,030 --> 1:12:45,820
Chase

1240
1:12:46,100 --> 1:12:47,060
Go!

1241
1:12:47,830 --> 1:12:48,920
Come her and grab me

1242
1:12:50,200 --> 1:12:53,190
Ok, do it...Ok! It's coming

1243
1:12:55,530 --> 1:12:57,020
The Longevity Monk was born go to get him!

1244
1:12:57,060 --> 1:12:58,050
Yes!

1245
1:13:02,930 --> 1:13:05,160
The baby looks like you

1246
1:13:08,560 --> 1:13:09,790
I think

1247
1:13:10,200 --> 1:13:11,490
being an immortal or not is not important

1248
1:13:12,030 --> 1:13:14,390
The flesh of the Longevity Monk isn't must, too

1249
1:13:15,030 --> 1:13:17,930
We have to live together happily

1250
1:13:18,430 --> 1:13:19,790
Bring our son up

1251
1:13:20,030 --> 1:13:21,820
Don't let him be robber

1252
1:13:22,830 --> 1:13:24,090
You want the Longevity Monk most

1253
1:13:24,430 --> 1:13:26,520
Just call him Longevity

1254
1:13:28,400 --> 1:13:29,420
Who?

1255
1:13:29,660 --> 1:13:31,460
It is too coincident

1256
1:13:31,900 --> 1:13:32,860
What do you want?

1257
1:13:34,400 --> 1:13:35,690
Your baby?

1258
1:13:37,960 --> 1:13:40,260
My baby with Joker!

1259
1:13:41,900 --> 1:13:43,020
What are you talking about?

1260
1:13:45,200 --> 1:13:47,660
Maiden, tell him

1261
1:13:48,700 --> 1:13:49,790
Tell him!

1262
1:13:55,630 --> 1:13:56,790
Yes!

1263
1:13:58,830 --> 1:14:01,060
this is her baby with Joker

1264
1:14:05,700 --> 1:14:06,590
Go!

1265
1:14:08,600 --> 1:14:09,820
See where you can go

1266
1:14:10,160 --> 1:14:11,150
No need to scare, I'm gonna protect you

1267
1:14:11,730 --> 1:14:12,490
Who the hell you are?

1268
1:14:12,700 --> 1:14:13,590
You're not qualified to protect me

1269
1:14:14,030 --> 1:14:14,930
Get lost

1270
1:14:15,860 --> 1:14:16,830
take my son away

1271
1:14:20,830 --> 1:14:21,590
Come here!

1272
1:14:21,830 --> 1:14:22,730
Give me the Longevity Monk

1273
1:14:23,260 --> 1:14:24,390
I'm not calling you to come

1274
1:14:25,860 --> 1:14:26,560
This is my son

1275
1:14:26,760 --> 1:14:27,820
not the Longevity Monk

1276
1:14:28,030 --> 1:14:29,090
Help!

1277
1:14:30,760 --> 1:14:33,250
Help...

1278
1:14:33,600 --> 1:14:36,090
You're concerned about me I'll die for you

1279
1:14:46,700 --> 1:14:47,420
Take my son away

1280
1:14:47,630 --> 1:14:48,390
Don't go!

1281
1:14:48,560 --> 1:14:49,650
Go

1282
1:14:50,300 --> 1:14:51,280
Ma'am 30th

1283
1:14:56,360 --> 1:14:57,590
It is lucky that we can go out

1284
1:15:09,230 --> 1:15:10,390
Jing Jing

1285
1:15:36,000 --> 1:15:36,930
Honey

1286
1:15:38,460 --> 1:15:39,290
Tortoise Magic

1287
1:15:42,260 --> 1:15:43,230
Slash your liver, stomach

1288
1:15:43,460 --> 1:15:44,550
and internal organs!

1289
1:15:48,200 --> 1:15:49,350
Tie it with a knot

1290
1:15:50,130 --> 1:15:51,190
Here comes the spirit

1291
1:15:55,460 --> 1:15:57,190
Bitch, don't step on my intestine

1292
1:15:57,430 --> 1:15:58,550
I wanna do so

1293
1:16:14,730 --> 1:16:16,700
Honey...!

1294
1:16:17,730 --> 1:16:18,750
My wife is inside

1295
1:16:18,800 --> 1:16:19,850
Please help me!

1296
1:16:20,100 --> 1:16:20,960
I'm not free

1297
1:16:21,330 --> 1:16:22,630
Thanks!

1298
1:16:24,830 --> 1:16:25,450
Come out!

1299
1:16:25,600 --> 1:16:26,390
Go!

1300
1:16:30,300 --> 1:16:32,160
Can we go back to the past?

1301
1:16:40,200 --> 1:16:42,130
Hurry up! Go!

1302
1:16:42,330 --> 1:16:43,660
I won't! Let's go together

1303
1:16:44,500 --> 1:16:45,390
Listen to me

1304
1:16:46,500 --> 1:16:48,160
Bring up my son

1305
1:16:52,430 --> 1:16:53,360
Go!

1306
1:16:56,430 --> 1:16:58,660
Our son! Honey!

1307
1:16:59,530 --> 1:17:00,790
you have to leave or I'll die!

1308
1:17:01,830 --> 1:17:02,920
No!

1309
1:17:10,430 --> 1:17:14,690
Honey...Honey...

1310
1:17:15,230 --> 1:17:16,460
Honey!

1311
1:17:17,160 --> 1:17:18,320
the moon is rising!

1312
1:17:18,530 --> 1:17:19,650
Honey

1313
1:17:21,660 --> 1:17:22,530
Ok!

1314
1:17:23,100 --> 1:17:26,360
What's that? I've forgot that!

1315
1:17:26,900 --> 1:17:33,730
Boyi Bolomi...

1316
1:17:35,360 --> 1:17:38,260
Being immortal!

1317
1:17:39,660 --> 1:17:41,650
Great! We're going back to the past

1318
1:17:43,700 --> 1:17:45,720
Wait for me!

1319
1:17:46,500 --> 1:17:48,460
The killer is leaving

1320
1:17:50,400 --> 1:17:54,990
Honey...My wife

1321
1:17:55,260 --> 1:17:57,060
Your wife is coming out, easy!

1322
1:17:58,130 --> 1:18:00,360
I've not finished. How do you know?

1323
1:18:02,860 --> 1:18:03,950
She's coming out. Go!

1324
1:18:04,860 --> 1:18:08,890
Honey, honey...

1325
1:18:10,160 --> 1:18:12,460
Boyi Bolomi!

1326
1:18:14,230 --> 1:18:16,290
Being immortal again!

1327
1:18:17,660 --> 1:18:19,190
Why did you say again?

1328
1:18:21,760 --> 1:18:27,320
Wait...

1329
1:18:28,660 --> 1:18:29,690
Again!

1330
1:18:31,300 --> 1:18:35,020
Honey...!

1331
1:18:37,160 --> 1:18:38,720
Don't disturb me!

1332
1:18:42,330 --> 1:18:44,420
Why did you tell me not to disturb you?

1333
1:18:44,730 --> 1:18:45,750
Shit! You're annoying!

1334
1:18:45,960 --> 1:18:48,120
I know I'm annoying

1335
1:18:48,330 --> 1:18:49,420
Why?

1336
1:18:50,200 --> 1:18:50,680
You come out!

1337
1:18:50,930 --> 1:18:52,090
Go, go!

1338
1:18:53,400 --> 1:18:57,730
Honey...

1339
1:18:58,160 --> 1:19:00,750
Boyi Bolomi

1340
1:19:01,100 --> 1:19:02,430
You're also very annoying

1341
1:19:04,030 --> 1:19:08,550
Wait...

1342
1:19:11,030 --> 1:19:14,690
Damn, I'm very tired

1343
1:19:15,600 --> 1:19:20,430
Honey...

1344
1:19:24,660 --> 1:19:25,650
Give me

1345
1:19:30,960 --> 1:19:32,930
I won't tell you!

1346
1:19:35,700 --> 1:19:37,860
That's fine

1347
1:19:38,130 --> 1:19:39,290
Why did you do so?

1348
1:19:41,060 --> 1:19:45,720
Honey...

1349
1:19:45,930 --> 1:19:49,160
Boyi Bolomi...

1350
1:19:52,060 --> 1:19:55,030
Honey, come out with King Bull and see Jesus

1351
1:20:03,130 --> 1:20:05,560
Stop!

1352
1:20:10,600 --> 1:20:11,790
Commit suicide

1353
1:20:12,000 --> 1:20:13,550
Why commit suicide?

1354
1:20:15,130 --> 1:20:17,960
No, I prefer killing you!

1355
1:20:26,400 --> 1:20:28,190
Hero!

1356
1:20:28,830 --> 1:20:30,390
You let me go!

1357
1:20:30,700 --> 1:20:31,750
Let you go?

1358
1:20:32,100 --> 1:20:33,620
Tell me a reason why I have to let you go

1359
1:20:34,660 --> 1:20:37,690
You tell me a reason why you wanna kill me

1360
1:20:37,860 --> 1:20:39,920
Ok, you leave me alone

1361
1:20:40,130 --> 1:20:41,190
and you have a baby with my sister

1362
1:20:41,530 --> 1:20:42,620
No, that's not the case Wanna die?

1363
1:20:42,860 --> 1:20:44,090
No, hero!

1364
1:20:44,300 --> 1:20:46,280
I left because I wanna get medication for you from you sister

1365
1:20:46,560 --> 1:20:47,360
But I was late

1366
1:20:47,600 --> 1:20:49,390
I couldn't find you

1367
1:20:49,660 --> 1:20:50,420
You deceive me!

1368
1:20:50,800 --> 1:20:51,520
You don't trust me

1369
1:20:53,530 --> 1:20:54,650
You look

1370
1:20:58,600 --> 1:20:59,460
Where have they been?

1371
1:20:59,630 --> 1:21:00,320
What's up?

1372
1:21:02,000 --> 1:21:03,020
You can't leave!

1373
1:21:04,900 --> 1:21:06,790
When the rock is put down the door is closed

1374
1:21:16,460 --> 1:21:20,050
Honey...

1375
1:21:24,960 --> 1:21:25,720
Let me do this

1376
1:21:26,030 --> 1:21:27,000
Go!

1377
1:21:29,360 --> 1:21:31,160
Joker, see you in the next life

1378
1:21:31,560 --> 1:21:33,220
Honey

1379
1:21:34,100 --> 1:21:35,890

1380
1:21:36,130 --> 1:21:41,430

1382
1:21:46,530 --> 1:21:49,980
Boyi Bolomi...

1383
1:22:00,300 --> 1:22:01,920
Jing Jing

1384
1:22:26,360 --> 1:22:29,120
Where are they?

1385
1:22:31,400 --> 1:22:32,790
What's going on?

1386
1:23:02,160 --> 1:23:03,220
Immortal?

1387
1:23:04,800 --> 1:23:05,950
Devil?

1388
1:23:08,100 --> 1:23:09,190
Thanks!

1389
1:23:12,000 --> 1:23:13,690
Don't go into the Spider Web Cave!

1390
1:23:14,930 --> 1:23:16,520
Spider Web Cave?

1391
1:23:17,100 --> 1:23:18,190
You think I'm illiterate?

1392
1:23:18,530 --> 1:23:19,830
Waterfall Cave

1393
1:23:27,230 --> 1:23:29,920
Spider Web Cave. It is a good name

1394
1:23:35,360 --> 1:23:37,420
Spider Web Cave

1395
1:23:39,700 --> 1:23:41,160
We'll live here onwards

1396
1:23:41,730 --> 1:23:42,460
Stop!

1397
1:23:52,730 --> 1:23:54,290
I wanna announce

1398
1:23:54,530 --> 1:23:56,290
In this hill, all things belong to me

1399
1:23:56,560 --> 1:23:57,320
Including you

1400
1:23:57,600 --> 1:23:58,290

1401
1:23:58,700 --> 1:23:59,720

1402
1:23:59,960 --> 1:24:01,790

1403
1:24:07,960 --> 1:24:09,490
You're mine now

1404
1:24:09,760 --> 1:24:11,820
If someone bully you you tell them you know me

1405
1:24:12,130 --> 1:24:14,360
I'm called Spider Web Immortal now!

1406
1:24:15,860 --> 1:24:17,620
Spider Web Immortal?

1407
1:24:18,500 --> 1:24:20,190
500 years?

1408
1:24:24,930 --> 1:24:26,920
You haven't turned into Monkey King

1409
1:24:27,130 --> 1:24:29,790
because you haven't met the guy having three birthmarks

1410
1:24:55,830 --> 1:24:57,320
Close the door
