29
0:03:22,950 --> 0:03:27,660
- 但他有点空虚 - 就像吸毒后兴奋起来

30
0:03:27,830 --> 0:03:30,200
不 这才是最奇怪的地方

31
0:03:30,370 --> 0:03:33,920
我可以在他想要的时候 尽可能地猛烈地打他

就像他上过拳击课 但并没有真正用心

She looks like me, but they weren't after her. They want Lisbeth Salander.

45
0:04:42,030 --> 0:04:45,360
所有这一切都与一个名叫扎拉的人有关
All this has something to do with a man named Zala.

 - She was found dead in a canal. - What about Bjurman?

好吧 达格沉默了 但谁会杀了萨兰德的监护人
OK that Dag was silenced, but who'd kill Salander's guardian?

49
0:05:01,340 --> 0:05:04,670
好的 不要把这些都拼凑在一起

50
0:05:04,840 --> 0:05:08,680
但扎拉和比约曼之间肯定有联系

- 你上次骗了我 就在这里 - 是吗 7
 - You lied to me last time was here! - Did 1?7

你假装你不认识他
You made out you didn't know him.

0:06:00,770 --> 0:06:04,280
我不需要告诉你我和谁共事过
don't have to tell you who I've worked with.

57
0:06:06,990 --> 0:06:09,200
你知道扎拉是谁吗

文章将消息来源描述为“她”

117
0:16:26,980 --> 0:16:30,860
报纸争相了解保罗·罗伯托在这件事中扮演的角色
The papers are clamouring to know Paolo Roberto's role in this.

118
0:16:31,030 --> 0:16:33,400
- 不是我 - 她说她不是泄密者

火已经熄灭了
The fire's out.

133
0:18:33,360 --> 0:18:39,200
他们带了一条狗来闻瓦砾中的身体
They brought in a dog to sniff out any dead bodies in the rubble.

134
0:18:39,360 --> 0:18:42,950
- 有吗 - 没有
 - And were there any? - No, there weren't.

135
0:18:43,120 --> 0:18:51,420
但当我们休息一下让狗的鼻子休息一下时 训导员散步了一下 把它放了下来
But when we took a break to give the dog's nose a rest, the handler took a walk and let him loose.

136
0:18:51,580 --> 0:18:53,340
他追踪到了什么东西

所以我们挖出了现场 发现了一具被切成六半的身体
So we dug up the spot and found a body, chopped into six parts.

138

139
0:19:01,430 --> 0:19:04,350
电锯 身体会不会是用电锯切开的
Chainsaw. Could the body have been cut up with a chainsaw?

保罗·罗伯托说 米里亚姆曾受到过一次威胁
Paolo Roberto said Miriam had been threatened with one.

那个保安警察呢 比耶克

154
0:20:35,900 --> 0:20:39,110
比耶克和比约曼打成平手
There's a tie between Bjérck and Bjurman.

155
0:20:39,270 --> 0:20:42,820
我和比耶克还没完呢
I'm not through with Bjérck yet.

156
0:20:42,990 --> 0:20:46,030
- 比耶雷克 - 布隆维斯特 你没回我电话

160
0:20:58,170 --> 0:21:00,710
你是我唯一的赌徒

161
0:21:00,880 --> 0:21:05,380
- 你答应给我时间的 - 是的 但是 我改变主意了 
 - You promised to give me time. - Yes, but changed my mind.

162
0:21:05,550 --> 0:21:10,050
如果你举行新闻发布会 你永远不会知道扎拉的事
If you hold that press conference, you'll never learn about Zala.

163
0:21:10,220 --> 0:21:14,060
这是可能的 但那就不再是我的问题了
That's possible, but then it won't be my problem anymore.

164
0:21:14,230 --> 0:21:17,940
你得跟警方的官方调查人员谈谈
You'll have to talk to the official police inquiry

165

- 以及其他媒体 - 站在那里别动

你正式回到这个案子上了 索尼娅

173
0:21:56,390 --> 0:22:02,070
不过 如果我是你 我不会指望埃克斯特雷姆道歉
Though I wouldn't expect an apology from Ekstrém if I were you.

174
0:22:02,230 --> 0:22:03,190
不是的
No.

175
0:22:03,360 --> 0:22:07,490
我不是一个谈论我的上级的狗屎 但他可以去吊死
I'm not one to talk shit about my superiors, but he can go hang.

176
0:22:25,340 --> 0:22:30,260
他的名字是亚历山大·萨拉琴科 但大家都叫他扎拉
His name is Alexander Zalachenko, but he's known as Zala.

177
0:22:30,430 --> 0:22:33,180
他是谁 在哪里能找到他
Who is he? Where can find him?

178
0:22:33,350 --> 0:22:37,180
- 他不是你想找的人 - 但是 我想
 - He's not someone you want to find. - But want to.

179
0:22:38,690 --> 0:22:41,900
- 他实际上并不存在 - 你是什么意思
 - He doesn't actually exist. - What do you mean?

180
0:22:45,780 --> 0:22:49,780
这是机密信息
This is classified information.

181
0:22:49,950 --> 0:22:55,370
希望你能理解 我的名字必须保密
hope you understand that my name must be kept secret.

182
0:22:55,540 --> 0:22:57,660
我已经同意了
I've agreed to that already.

183
0:22:57,830 --> 0:23:02,670
萨拉琴科1940年出生于苏联
Zalachenko was born in 1940, in the Soviet Union.

184
0:23:02,830 --> 0:23:05,750
他的父母都在第二次世界大战中去世

185
0:23:05,920 --> 0:23:12,220
- 希望你知道GRU是什么 - 他们的军事情报部门

186
0:23:12,390 --> 0:23:14,550
他在那里有很不错的职业生涯

187
0:23:14,720 --> 0:23:20,390
精通六种语言 擅长伪装 和生存
Fluent in six languages, an expert at camouflage... and survival.

188
0:23:20,560 --> 0:23:21,770
所以他被允许留下来
So he was allowed to stay.

189
0:23:21,940 --> 0:23:27,480
GRU的高级官员以前从未叛逃到瑞典
No senior officer of GRU had ever defected to Sweden before.

190
0:23:32,110 --> 0:23:35,120
比约曼适合在哪里
Where does Bjurman fit in?

191
0:23:35,280 --> 0:23:41,500
嗯 那时候我们还年轻 25 30
Well, we were young back then. 25, 30.

192
0:23:41,660 --> 0:23:47,670
完全没有资格照顾像萨拉琴科这样的人
Completely unqualified to take care of a man like Zalachenko.

193
0:23:47,840 --> 0:23:52,260
1976年 他在选举日现身
He showed up on election day, in 1976.

194
0:23:52,430 --> 0:23:55,680
警察总部几乎空无一人
Police headquarters was practically empty.

195
0:23:55,850 --> 0:24:00,390
几乎每个人都外出执行特别任务
Nearly everyone was out on special duty.

196
0:24:00,560 --> 0:24:04,770
当时他随叫随到 以为自己是个普通的难民
was on call, and thought he was an ordinary refugee.

197
0:24:04,940 --> 0:24:08,940
所以 让比约曼一起来处理文书工作
So brought Bjurman along to manage the paperwork.

198
0:24:09,110 --> 0:24:13,150
比约曼牵涉其中纯属偶然
It was pure chance that Bjurman got involved.

199
0:24:13,320 --> 0:24:15,910
- Chance - 是的 事实上 
 - Chance? - Yes, actually.

200
0:24:16,950 --> 0:24:18,950
牵牛花
Morning glory.

201
0:24:20,080 --> 0:24:23,710
- 什么 - 它就是这么叫的
 - What? - That's what it's called.

0:24:26,330 --> 0:24:31,420
- 萨拉琴科在哪里 - 1985年之前一直是他的联系人

0:24:31,590 --> 0:24:33,930
在那之后 被分配到其他任务

204
0:24:35,680 --> 0:24:39,640
你给了他一个新身份和一个瑞典名字 他的瑞典名字叫什么
You gave him a new identity and a Swedish name. What's his Swedish name?

205
0:24:39,810 --> 0:24:42,350
- 我不会告诉你的 - 来吧 
 - won't tell you that. - Come on.

206
0:24:42,520 --> 0:24:48,270
我已经告诉过你扎拉是谁 这就是你得到的一切 直到你知道你会信守诺言
I've told you who Zala is and that's all you get until know you'll keep your word.

207
0:24:48,440 --> 0:24:52,490
他犯了三起谋杀罪 警察走错了路
He's committed three murders. The police are on the wrong track.

208
0:24:52,650 --> 0:24:55,150
你为什么这么确定不是利斯贝丝·萨兰德干的
Why are you so sure Lisbeth Salander didn't do it?

209
0:24:55,320 --> 0:24:59,910
我相信是萨拉琴科干的 - 你错了 
 - believe Zalachenko did it. - You're wrong.

210
0:25:00,080 --> 0:25:04,120
扎拉没有向任何人开枪 他69岁了 是个残疾人
Zala didn't shoot anyone. He's 69 and handicapped.

211
0:25:04,290 --> 0:25:09,750
这家伙需要拐杖 所以他不能到处跑来跑去开枪射击
The guy needs a crutch, so he can't exactly run around shooting people.

212
0:25:09,920 --> 0:25:14,050
他需要打电话给移动服务中心才能找到受害者
He'd need to call the mobility service to get to his victims.

213
0:25:14,220 --> 0:25:17,720
希望不会在报纸上看到我的名字
hope won't be seeing my name in the papers.

214
0:25:30,940 --> 0:25:34,860
你是说莉斯贝丝·萨兰德出现了
So you're telling me that Lisbeth Salander showed up

215
0:25:35,030 --> 0:25:38,240
单枪匹马把几个摩托车手打得落花流水

216
0:25:38,410 --> 0:25:39,820

Yes.

她是由保罗·罗伯托训练的

- 我刚认识比耶克 - 很好

他说完了吗 我们能用他吗

230
0:26:47,100 --> 0:26:49,440
这次不行 他不会被包括在内

231
0:26:49,600 --> 0:26:51,940
- 什么意思 - 我晚点再告诉你

你什么时候来 索尼娅·莫迪格来了

他们想让我们帮忙检查达格的材料 我们不能放过任何人

234
0:27:00,700 --> 0:27:03,160

236
0:27:18,970 --> 0:27:25,010
他愿意见你 但如果他不喜欢你 他会把你赶出去的
He's willing to see you. But if he doesn't like you, he'll throw you out.

237
0:27:25,180 --> 0:27:29,430
不能接受采访 不能在媒体上发表任何内容 明白吗
No interviews and nothing in the media, is that clear?

238

don't think Lisbeth Salander's involved in these killings.

243
0:28:06,140 --> 0:28:11,140
我认为这一切的幕后黑手是一个叫萨拉琴科的人
think a man named Zalachenko is behind it all.

244
0:28:15,100 --> 0:28:16,900
坐下

但他们从未结婚

0:30:40,120 --> 0:30:50,800
当利斯贝丝出生时 阿格尼塔将她的名字从Sj6élander改为Salander
When Lisbeth was born, Agneta changed her name from Sj6élander to Salander.

261
0:30:50,970 --> 0:30:56,600
这是一种证明他们是一对情侣的方式
It was a way to demonstrate that they were a couple.

262
0:30:56,770 --> 0:30:59,060
你是什么意思
What do you mean?

263
0:30:59,230 --> 0:31:01,850
扎拉 - 萨兰德
Zala - Salander.

264
0:31:03,560 --> 0:31:05,270
上帝啊

265
0:31:09,860 --> 0:31:14,080
萨拉琴科不怎么在家
Zalachenko wasn't home much.

266
0:31:14,240 --> 0:31:17,790
其他人几乎不知道他在哪里
The others hardly knew where he was.

267
0:31:17,950 --> 0:31:21,670
但他时不时地会出现
But every now and then he'd show up...

268
0:31:22,080 --> 0:31:26,210
在他们伦达格坦的家中 
...at their home on Lundagatan.

269
0:31:26,380 --> 0:31:30,340
每一次 这种情况都会发生
And every time, this would happen.

270
0:31:30,510 --> 0:31:40,180
他会喝醉 他会殴打阿格尼塔 性侵她 然后离开

271
0:31:42,770 --> 0:31:47,230
这种事已经发生了几十次了
It happened dozens of times.

272
0:31:47,400 --> 0:31:53,360
社会服务机构本应做些什么 但什么也没做

273
0:31:53,530 --> 0:31:57,790

275
0:32:04,380 --> 0:32:06,290

丽斯贝丝 年仅12岁

277
0:32:16,260 --> 0:32:19,390
萨拉琴科要离开了
Zalachenko was leaving...

278
0:32:20,850 --> 0:32:27,520
丽斯贝丝很害怕她的母亲会伤害自己
...and Lisbeth was terrified that her mother would harm herself.

279
0:32:30,610 --> 0:32:34,030
她逃学了
She played truant from school.

280
0:32:34,200 --> 0:32:43,580
当利斯贝思发现母亲昏迷在厨房地板上时 萨拉琴科笑了

但丽斯贝丝紧随其后

天哪

285
0:33:09,480 --> 0:33:15,610
一个男人正坐在他的车里 像火炬一样燃烧

286
0:33:17,280 --> 0:33:21,330
这一次是有后果的

她母亲在医院度过了她生命的最后几年
Her mother spent the last years of her life in hospital.

290
0:33:37,800 --> 0:33:40,300
从那以后 她就再也不是自己了

291
0:33:42,600 --> 0:33:47,850

警方拒绝透露细节 但表示这其中存在关联

305
0:35:08,850 --> 0:35:15,650
与一周前发生的三起谋杀案有关

306
0:35:15,820 --> 0:35:19,360
警方今晚将举行记者招待会

307
0:35:19,530 --> 0:35:22,450
在我们最新的公告中有更多关于这一点的信息
More on that in our late bulletin.

308
0:35:33,670 --> 0:35:36,630
现在是一些交通警报

309
0:35:36,800 --> 0:35:42,430
一辆急救车正从S高速驶向萨瓦韦尔乔
An emergency vehicle is travelling at speed from Sédertélje to Svavelsjo.

310
0:35:42,590 --> 0:35:47,600
如果你在这一地区 请注意
If you are in the area, please be aware...

311
0:35:47,770 --> 0:35:54,150
Teleborian和Bjérck肯定有某种合作协议
Teleborian and Bjérck must have had some kind of cooperation agreement.

312
0:35:58,280 --> 0:36:01,950
我不明白为什么这么多年你什么都不做
don't understand why you didn't do anything during all those years.

313
0:36:02,110 --> 0:36:06,950
是利斯贝思的监护人
was Lisbeth's guardian.

314
0:36:07,120 --> 0:36:10,160
所以她只是长长的队伍中的一个
So she was just one in a long line...

315
0:36:11,250 --> 0:36:15,380
有问题的男孩和女孩
...of boys and girls with problems.

316
0:36:17,460 --> 0:36:21,470
Teleborian宣称利斯贝思有精神病

317
0:36:21,630 --> 0:36:26,430
可以在圣斯特凡医院得到最好的照顾
and could receive the best possible care at St Stefan's.

318
0:36:26,600 --> 0:36:30,770
我相信了他 当然 相信了他
believed him. Of course believed him.

319
0:36:30,930 --> 0:36:32,520
比耶克呢
And Bjérck?

320
0:36:33,560 --> 0:36:36,730
他想要她承诺
He wanted her committed.

321
0:36:36,900 --> 0:36:40,190
为她的事业辩护
defended her cause.

322
0:36:40,360 --> 0:36:45,570
我不想让她被关在某个机构里度过一生
didn't want her to spend her life incarcerated in some institution.

323
0:36:45,740 --> 0:36:50,490
因此 妥协是对无能的宣示
So the compromise was a declaration of incompetency.

324
0:36:50,660 --> 0:36:55,290
并被指定为她的监护人
And was appointed her guardian.

325
0:36:57,420 --> 0:37:02,050
别责备自己了 你是为数不多的支持她的人之一
Don't blame yourself. You were one of the few who stood up for her.

326
0:37:02,210 --> 0:37:08,640
但我明白她为什么会和当局和心理学家有矛盾
But can see why she has issues with the authorities and psychologists.

327
0:37:11,850 --> 0:37:14,770
当你中风的时候
When you had your stroke...

328
0:37:15,890 --> 0:37:19,270
你认为比约曼得到这份工作只是偶然的吗
Do you think Bjurman got the job just by chance?

329
0:37:19,440 --> 0:37:21,570
- 没有 - 没有
 - No. - No.

330
0:37:22,860 --> 0:37:25,070
我也是
Me neither.

331
0:37:25,400 --> 0:37:32,080
媒体对保罗·罗伯托牵涉其中的猜测甚嚣尘上
There's wild media speculation about Paolo Roberto's involvement in this.

332
0:37:33,620 --> 0:37:39,380
我们可能会收到大量关于链接的问题
We'll probably get loads of questions about links here and there.

333
0:37:39,540 --> 0:37:46,590
因此 我们必须专注于关于利斯贝丝·萨兰德的问题
So we must focus on questions concerning Lisbeth Salander.

334
0:37:46,760 --> 0:37:52,260
这是我们从公众那里得到关于她下落的线报的机会
This is our chance to get tip-offs from the public as to her whereabouts

335
0:37:52,430 --> 0:37:54,770
这样我们才能打破僵局
so we can break this deadlock.

336
0:38:06,900 --> 0:38:08,990
嗨
Hi.

337
0:38:09,160 --> 0:38:13,450
亚历山大·萨拉琴科这个名字对你有什么意义吗
Does the name Alexander Zalachenko mean anything to you?

338
0:38:13,620 --> 0:38:19,790
- 没有 我很快就会有一个新闻发布会 - 又名扎拉 你知道这个名字
 - No. I've got a press briefing soon. - Aka Zala. You know that name.

339
0:38:21,080 --> 0:38:26,220
亚历山大·萨拉琴科是利斯贝思·萨兰德的父亲
Alexander Zalachenko is Lisbeth Salander's father.

340
0:38:26,380 --> 0:38:31,890
1993年 她向他扔了一枚燃烧弹 警方对此事进行了调查
She threw a fire bomb at him in 1993, and the police investigated the matter.

341
0:38:32,050 --> 0:38:36,350
- 是安全警察 - 为什么会这样
 - It was the security police. - Why is that?

342
0:38:36,520 --> 0:38:39,940
因为亚历山大·萨拉琴科为他们工作
Because Alexander Zalachenko worked for them.

343
0:38:40,100 --> 0:38:44,690
他们不想让它公之于众 你看 他并不是正式存在的
They didn't want it made public. He doesn't officially exist, you see.

344
0:38:44,860 --> 0:38:50,030
- 你从哪里得到这些信息的 - 我希望你能找到这些文件
 - Where did you get this information? - want you to find the files.

345
0:38:50,200 --> 0:38:53,950
他们一定在那里的某个地方
They've got to be in there somewhere.

346
0:38:55,700 --> 0:39:00,370
我相信这些文件会带我们找到萨拉琴科
believe the files will lead us to Zalachenko.

347
0:39:00,540 --> 0:39:05,130
我相信他和达格和米娅的死有关
And I'm convinced he was involved in Dag and Mia's deaths.

348
0:39:05,300 --> 0:39:08,920
甚至可能是比约曼的死
Possibly even Bjurman's death.

349
0:39:09,090 --> 0:39:12,390
但不可能是莉斯贝丝·萨兰德 对吧
But it couldn't be Lisbeth Salander, right?

350
0:39:12,550 --> 0:39:16,310
枪上有她的指纹
Her prints are on the gun.

351
0:39:16,470 --> 0:39:20,190
- 我知道这看起来很奇怪 - 它真的很棒
 - I know It seems strange. - It damn well does.

352
0:39:20,350 --> 0:39:25,980
你们两个是怎么回事 如果她是无辜的 为什么她不站出来
What's up between you two? Why doesn't she come forward if she's innocent?

353
0:39:26,150 --> 0:39:28,650
因为莉斯贝丝是
Because Lisbeth is...

354
0:39:32,070 --> 0:39:33,660
她是个非常注重隐私的人
She's a very private person.

355
0:39:33,820 --> 0:39:39,080
我不喜欢这些针对警方的指控
don't like these allegations against the police.

356
0:39:39,250 --> 0:39:43,420
我们的问题已经够多了 我们不需要什么业余私家侦探的帮助
We have enough problems. We don't need the help of some amateur private eye.

357
0:39:54,600 --> 0:40:02,770
避暑山庄枪击案、保罗·罗伯托案和米里亚姆·吴被绑架案之间有联系吗
Is there a link between the summer house shooting, Paolo Roberto and Miriam Wu's kidnap?

358
0:40:03,900 --> 0:40:15,370
不 没有任何迹象表明Salander参与了对Miriam Wu的绑架
No, there is nothing to suggest that Salander was involved in the kidnapping of Miriam Wu.

359
0:40:17,280 --> 0:40:20,870
你仍然认为利斯贝思对公众构成威胁吗
Do you still regard Lisbeth as posing a public threat?

360
0:40:23,170 --> 0:40:27,250
她开枪打死了一个人 她有武器
She shot a man. She's armed.

361
0:40:27,420 --> 0:40:30,670
所以很明显我们想要联系上她
So obviously we'd like to get hold of her.

362
0:40:30,840 --> 0:40:34,340
你知道是谁绑架了米里亚姆·吴吗
Do you know who kidnapped Miriam Wu?

363
0:40:36,300 --> 0:40:40,600
我会把这个问题交给简·布布兰斯基
I'll turn that question over to Jan Bublanski.

364
0:40:42,230 --> 0:40:46,230
关于今天的枪击案 我们已经确认了一名男子
In connection with today's shooting, we have identified a man

365
0:40:46,400 --> 0:40:52,740
可能是他在绑架未遂时开的货车

366
0:40:52,900 --> 0:40:57,990
- 被枪击的那个人 - 拒绝对此发表评论
 - The man who was shot? - decline to comment on that.

367
0:40:58,160 --> 0:41:06,040
然而 我们没有关于袭击吴和罗伯托的人的线索
However, we have no leads on the person who assaulted Wu and Roberto.

 - But, look, he ran over my dog. - Sorry. We need a police report.

380
0:42:27,710 --> 0:42:29,250

某些事实表明这是一场黑社会纠纷
Certain facts indicate an underworld dispute.

385
0:42:50,980 --> 0:42:54,020
他们一点都不明白
They haven't understood a damn thing!

0:42:55,360 --> 0:42:59,700
布布兰斯基不会听的 他们在追查错误的线索
Bublanski won't listen. They're chasing the wrong lead.

387
0:42:59,860 --> 0:43:04,200

1:16:19,820 --> 1:16:22,910
你有他想要的这部电影
You had this film he wanted.

564
1:16:24,620 --> 1:16:27,700
并且 有一个适度的商业运作
And have a modest business operation.

565
1:16:32,960 --> 1:16:35,250
他真的强奸了你吗
Did he really rape you?

566
1:16:39,210 --> 1:16:43,380
天哪 这家伙一定很有品味
Christ, the guy must have god-awful taste.

567
1:16:45,600 --> 1:16:50,770
也许我会让尼德曼给你一个好的轴系 看起来你需要它
Maybe I'll ask Niederman to give you a good shafting. Looks like you need it.

568
1:16:52,020 --> 1:16:54,480
你为什么不自己来做呢
Why don't you do it yourself?

569
1:16:56,860 --> 1:17:00,110
坐 坐下
Sit. Sit down!

570
1:17:00,280 --> 1:17:04,320
否则就会像狗一样射杀你
Or will shoot you like a dog.

571
1:17:04,490 --> 1:17:07,120
为什么不给你一个好的轴系呢
Why don't give you a good shafting?

572
1:17:09,120 --> 1:17:11,370
那将是
That would be...

573
1:17:14,000 --> 1:17:16,330
变态
...perverse.

574
1:17:20,670 --> 1:17:23,470
你在哪里找到那个怪胎的
Where did you find that freak?

575
1:17:23,630 --> 1:17:26,390
你是说你还没想明白吗
Do you mean you haven't figured it out?

576
1:17:28,050 --> 1:17:32,020
他们说你是个技术高超的研究员
They say you're a skilled researcher.

577
1:17:32,180 --> 1:17:35,060
但我猜这不是真的
But guess that's not true.

578
1:17:35,230 --> 1:17:43,570
尼德曼在你的小燃烧弹后康复的时候帮助了我
Niederman helped me when was convalescing after your little fire bomb.

579
1:17:43,740 --> 1:17:46,660
现在 它更像是一种伙伴关系
Now it's more of a partnership.

580
1:17:46,820 --> 1:17:50,370
你的意思是说你还没有意识到他是谁
Do you mean to say you haven't realised who he is?

581
1:17:52,790 --> 1:17:55,620
他是你的兄弟
He's your brother.

582
1:17:55,790 --> 1:18:00,840
什么 - 实际上他是你同父异母的兄弟
 - What? - Actually, he's your half-brother.

583
1:18:01,000 --> 1:18:05,590
这是很久以前在德国的一次放纵的结果
The result of a fling long ago, in Germany.

584
1:18:48,680 --> 1:18:51,180
最后一次
A last one.

585
1:19:13,700 --> 1:19:18,670
尼德曼也杀了比约曼吗 为什么
Did Niederman kill Bjurman, too? Why?

586
1:19:18,830 --> 1:19:24,420
比约曼是个傻瓜 他有属于我的文件
Bjurman was a fool, and he had documents that belonged to me.

587
1:19:24,590 --> 1:19:28,090
他是为数不多的知道我过去的人之一
He was one of the few people who knew about my past.

588
1:19:28,260 --> 1:19:31,930
我不相信他会守口如瓶
couldn't trust him to keep his mouth shut.

589
1:19:32,100 --> 1:19:36,470
尤其是当那些记者四处打探的时候
Particularly when those journalists were poking around.

590
1:19:36,640 --> 1:19:39,270
这太过分了
It was too much.

591
1:19:41,940 --> 1:19:47,900
他居然愚蠢地告诉我们他有一把手枪
And he was stupid enough to tell us that he owned a pistol.

592
1:19:48,070 --> 1:19:51,030
上面有指纹的手枪
A pistol with fingerprints on it.

593
1:19:53,120 --> 1:19:55,160
你的指纹
Your fingerprints.

594
1:19:55,330 --> 1:19:57,950
你不该碰那把枪的 丽斯贝丝
You shouldn't have touched the gun, Lisbeth.

595
1:20:00,000 --> 1:20:03,670
你太马虎了 警察会找到你的
You've been too sloppy. The police will find you.

596
1:20:03,840 --> 1:20:07,630
哦 天哪 我好害怕
Oh, dear, I'm so scared.

597
1:20:09,880 --> 1:20:11,840
没有向任何人开枪
didn't shoot anybody.

598
1:20:14,300 --> 1:20:17,020
他们可以确定他们想要的该死的人
They can identify who the hell they want.

599
1:20:17,180 --> 1:20:22,270
我只是个可怜的老跛子 对吧
I'm just a poor old cripple, right?

600
1:20:22,440 --> 1:20:25,860
是保安警察把你关进监狱的 不是我
It was the Security Police who had you committed, not me.

601
1:20:26,020 --> 1:20:30,700
他们不会把所有的牌都放在桌子上 哦 不
And they won't be putting all their cards on the table, oh, no.

602
1:20:30,860 --> 1:20:35,700
你仍将是他们所有谋杀案的头号嫌疑犯
You will remain their prime suspect for all those murders.

603
1:20:39,910 --> 1:20:41,000
准备好的?
Ready?

604
1:21:41,600 --> 1:21:44,940
也许我该说点什么
Maybe should say something.

605
1:21:45,100 --> 1:21:47,650
但是 我想我没有什么要对你说的
But don't think have anything to say to you.

606
1:21:49,270 --> 1:21:53,990
- 我也是 - 让我们把这件事做完 
 - That goes for me, too. - Let's get this over with.

607
1:21:54,150 --> 1:21:59,410
我抓到你了 这对我来说已经足够了 警察今晚会来的
I've nailed you, that's good enough for me. The cops will be here tonight.

608
1:22:00,450 --> 1:22:02,330
犯傻呀
Bullshit!

609
1:22:03,580 --> 1:22:07,290
预计会有一些虚张声势
expected some bluffing.

610
1:22:07,460 --> 1:22:11,170
但你是来杀我的 仅此而已
But you came here to kill me, and that's that.

611
1:22:11,340 --> 1:22:15,760
- 你没有和任何人说过话 - 能给你看点东西吗
 - You haven't talked to anyone. - Can show you something?

612
1:22:23,680 --> 1:22:27,770
你过去一个小时所说的一切都已经在网上播出了
Everything you've said for the past hour has been broadcast online.

613
1:22:29,690 --> 1:22:31,770
让我想想
Let me see.

614
1:22:40,370 --> 1:22:42,120
不是的
No.

615
1:22:43,200 --> 1:22:45,910
用这个是不可能的
Not possible with this.

616
1:23:04,430 --> 1:23:06,180
白痴
Idiot!

617
1:23:11,020 --> 1:23:13,520
你在等什么?
What are you waiting for?

618
1:23:15,490 --> 1:23:19,070
看在上帝的份上 昂首挺胸
Head high, for Christ's sake.

619
1:30:49,400 --> 1:30:51,770
我来了
I'm here.

620
1:30:53,480 --> 1:30:55,190
我来了
I'm here.

621
1:31:02,910 --> 1:31:05,040
丽斯贝丝
