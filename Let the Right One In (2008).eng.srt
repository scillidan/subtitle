1
0:00:33,500 --> 0:00:35,270
Blue for constancy.

2
0:00:35,400 --> 0:00:38,290
Flesh for flesh. Straw for plenty.

3
0:00:38,350 --> 0:00:40,290
Red for justice.

4
0:00:47,680 --> 0:00:48,950
Le Roi.

5
0:00:52,200 --> 0:00:55,660
The Palace of Whitehall London 1638

6
0:00:59,040 --> 0:01:02,420
Your cousin Harry is the envy of my court.

7
0:01:02,760 --> 0:01:05,920
Let's ask God to bless this union.

8
0:01:14,930 --> 0:01:16,590
'On the night of my birth,

9
0:01:16,720 --> 0:01:20,980
'a comet appeared in the sky and bells rang out.'

10
0:01:29,480 --> 0:01:30,800
A girl.

11
0:01:34,670 --> 0:01:37,210
'The bells did not herald my birth...

12
0:01:38,420 --> 0:01:42,240
'..but the killing of my mother's Catholic priest.

13
0:01:45,600 --> 0:01:49,070
'For Catholicism in England was seen as high treason.

14
0:01:53,340 --> 0:01:56,150
'Cousin Harry was my father's heir,

15
0:01:56,410 --> 0:01:58,470
'and my childhood playmate.'

16
0:01:58,470 --> 0:02:01,650
This is where my mother's priest used to come and go.

17
0:02:06,120 --> 0:02:08,150
Follow me, Harry.

18
0:02:10,450 --> 0:02:11,770
Be brave.

19
0:02:17,230 --> 0:02:18,830
Mother?

20
0:02:19,620 --> 0:02:20,870
Mother?

21
0:02:22,360 --> 0:02:25,030
Harry and I have a play to show you.

22
0:02:25,270 --> 0:02:27,540
Two birds that grow up and marry.

23
0:02:28,950 --> 0:02:30,440
Mother?

24
0:02:31,540 --> 0:02:34,180
I am your servant.

25
0:02:34,880 --> 0:02:36,630
Instruct me.

26
0:02:38,520 --> 0:02:39,440
Mother?

27
0:02:39,440 --> 0:02:42,710
'The Virgin Mary told my mother to leave me behind

28
0:02:42,710 --> 0:02:45,270
'and go to a nunnery in France.'

29
0:03:01,600 --> 0:03:02,820
Angelica...

30
0:03:03,550 --> 0:03:07,180
It is Our Lady's will that I give my life over to God.

31
0:03:11,160 --> 0:03:13,970
My bible is my farewell gift to you.

32
0:03:31,070 --> 0:03:33,310
Please don't leave me!

33
0:03:43,260 --> 0:03:46,160
'This was the day I lost my mother

34
0:03:46,320 --> 0:03:49,710
'and put my soul into the balance.'

35
0:03:57,930 --> 0:04:01,830
If there be a God that steals mothers, strike me down!

36
0:04:10,120 --> 0:04:13,620
There is no God! There is no God!

37
0:04:24,730 --> 0:04:29,340
乱世妖姬 第一季第1集

38
0:04:48,340 --> 0:04:50,990
Why do you weep, Angelica?

39
0:04:51,970 --> 0:04:54,640
Only for joy that this day has finally come.

40
0:05:03,610 --> 0:05:05,100
Make her ready.

41
0:05:10,120 --> 0:05:11,940
Harry, I've heard the Queen say

42
0:05:11,940 --> 0:05:15,330
Angelica was wild as a colt when first she came to Court.

43
0:05:15,800 --> 0:05:18,330
Her mother went to a nunnery in France, Highness,

44
0:05:18,470 --> 0:05:19,980
and then her father died.

45
0:05:20,600 --> 0:05:22,460
For a year or two, she was not herself.

46
0:05:22,590 --> 0:05:24,310
They tell me she saw devils.

47
0:05:24,370 --> 0:05:25,880
She was but a child, my Lord!

48
0:05:26,710 --> 0:05:28,620
It was her mind was wild, not her.

49
0:05:28,800 --> 0:05:30,210
A wild bedfellow then.

50
0:05:30,710 --> 0:05:34,140
I do love to see a woman with spirit, and a man to break it.

51
0:05:34,140 --> 0:05:36,050
She needs not be broken, my Lord.

52
0:05:36,740 --> 0:05:40,290
In faith I hope she be broken, Harry,in this very night.

53
0:05:40,290 --> 0:05:42,280
She's played false else.

54
0:05:45,990 --> 0:05:47,330
Your work awaits you.

55
0:05:47,330 --> 0:05:48,740
Not work...

56
0:05:49,690 --> 0:05:51,410
but the purest delight to me, my Lord.

57
0:05:51,410 --> 0:05:54,680
Angelica Fanshawe is a delight to all men, Harry.

58
0:06:07,850 --> 0:06:09,490
It's nothing, Angelica.

59
0:06:11,830 --> 0:06:14,020
If it is nothing then why may I not see?

60
0:06:27,500 --> 0:06:29,520
Shall Honest John Lilburne...

61
0:06:29,770 --> 0:06:31,800
not speak the truth

62
0:06:32,540 --> 0:06:37,420
about this King that tells us God gave him his throne?!

63
0:06:37,420 --> 0:06:39,480
I say to you, he is a tyrant

64
0:06:39,480 --> 0:06:41,720
that will not let his Parliament sit!

65
0:06:42,370 --> 0:06:44,940
Charles Stewart has no divine right.

66
0:06:45,070 --> 0:06:47,290
For writing this I am whipped!

67
0:06:47,470 --> 0:06:49,280
Will you recant, John?

68
0:06:49,280 --> 0:06:50,870
The King promises your freedom

69
0:06:50,870 --> 0:06:52,570
if you'll renounce your pamphlet.

70
0:06:53,260 --> 0:06:55,490
My liberty is his to take...

71
0:06:56,150 --> 0:06:58,040
..but not to give.

72
0:06:59,270 --> 0:07:01,830
I am free-born John Lilburne!

73
0:07:01,830 --> 0:07:04,590
Beg him to recant, madam!

74
0:07:13,280 --> 0:07:14,970
Do not recant, John.

75
0:07:21,320 --> 0:07:25,110
Plague Pits at the Spitel Field Near London

76
0:07:29,490 --> 0:07:32,360
'I closed my eyes and lived in the dark,

77
0:07:32,600 --> 0:07:37,220
choosing not to see the world outside was sick and running mad.

78
0:07:58,900 --> 0:07:59,940
Read his pamphlet.

79
0:07:59,940 --> 0:08:03,360
Read and remember. For Justice and Liberty.

80
0:08:11,390 --> 0:08:13,190
Your husband, madam?

81
0:08:13,280 --> 0:08:16,370
Aye. Honest John Lilburne.

82
0:08:16,370 --> 0:08:19,610
Whipped for raising his voice for justice and liberty.

83
0:08:20,590 --> 0:08:22,040
Welcome to Babylon, sir.

84
0:08:22,040 --> 0:08:23,770
Justice and liberty?

85
0:08:23,770 --> 0:08:25,630
He is mistook, madam.

86
0:08:26,720 --> 0:08:28,620
There's nought but these...

87
0:08:29,090 --> 0:08:30,930
since time began.

88
0:08:54,660 --> 0:08:57,240
Well, Sexby...

89
0:08:57,370 --> 0:08:58,950
I thought you were long dead by now.

90
0:08:58,950 --> 0:09:00,320
I am at your service, Highness.

91
0:09:00,320 --> 0:09:01,990
No-one left to kill in Germany?

92
0:09:02,250 --> 0:09:05,360
Not a one left to piss against a wall, Highness.

93
0:09:06,240 --> 0:09:09,630
Well, you've travelled in vain. I have no need of you.

94
0:09:09,740 --> 0:09:15,180
Yet I heard talk of a fight to come here in England.

95
0:09:16,370 --> 0:09:18,280
That the King must let his Parliament sit

96
0:09:19,990 --> 0:09:23,090
That their heads buzz with grievances against him.

97
0:09:23,480 --> 0:09:26,140
That this will not be settled by talk.

98
0:09:37,070 --> 0:09:39,980
Dear God, who is she?

99
0:09:40,720 --> 0:09:42,660
Remember the sewer you were born in

100
0:09:42,660 --> 0:09:44,750
and the hag that gave you life!

101
0:09:51,020 --> 0:09:52,360
Come to me later.

102
0:09:53,460 --> 0:09:55,880
There is a service you may perform for me.

103
0:09:56,600 --> 0:09:59,750
But there'll be no fight in England, Sexby.

104
0:10:06,180 --> 0:10:08,900
May I speak with you, my Lady?

105
0:10:10,740 --> 0:10:12,110
Let her speak.

106
0:10:12,230 --> 0:10:14,480
Quickly, madam, for I am waited on at the altar.

107
0:10:14,640 --> 0:10:17,940
My Lady, I am the wife of a man much misunderstood,

108
0:10:17,940 --> 0:10:18,950
Honest John Lilburne,

109
0:10:18,950 --> 0:10:20,830
that was whipped just now...        Whipped?

110
0:10:20,830 --> 0:10:23,610
Aye, most cruelly,

111
0:10:23,780 --> 0:10:26,300
and will die in the Fleet unless a voice like yours

112
0:10:26,360 --> 0:10:28,380
be raised up to help him.

113
0:10:28,630 --> 0:10:29,820
Wait!

114
0:10:31,790 --> 0:10:35,480
You might ask a favour of her Majesty on your wedding day.

115
0:10:35,610 --> 0:10:38,590
My Lady, Lilburne is the villain that

116
0:10:38,590 --> 0:10:40,330
writes lies about His Majesty.

117
0:10:44,400 --> 0:10:45,600
Madam, tell your husband

118
0:10:45,600 --> 0:10:47,990
there's no greater soul on this earth than the King.

119
0:10:48,510 --> 0:10:50,350
He is my second father.

120
0:10:50,830 --> 0:10:52,640
Then Honest John must die...

121
0:10:52,770 --> 0:10:55,240
and there is no liberty in this land.

122
0:11:55,350 --> 0:11:57,440
The garter! Yes!

123
0:11:57,640 --> 0:11:59,550
The garter! Yes!

124
0:11:59,550 --> 0:12:00,900
No, no, no, no!

125
0:12:54,400 --> 0:12:59,040
Over here! Me, Angelica! Me!

126
0:13:35,100 --> 0:13:37,280
I will have them both, sir.

127
0:14:00,240 --> 0:14:02,830
Let me be your friend a while longer.

128
0:14:03,280 --> 0:14:04,960
My boy Harry.

129
0:14:06,020 --> 0:14:09,140
You'll always be my best friend.

130
0:14:10,050 --> 0:14:12,570
But now I must be a husband.

131
0:14:14,460 --> 0:14:17,260
And you will be the best husband a woman ever had.

132
0:14:37,440 --> 0:14:40,440
What, Harry? Not at your work yet?

133
0:14:42,800 --> 0:14:45,730
A drink of sack.

134
0:14:45,730 --> 0:14:47,170
To make a "boy" lusty.

135
0:14:58,940 --> 0:15:02,700
Well, then, "my boy Harry..."

136
0:15:02,700 --> 0:15:04,150
To it.

137
0:15:16,160 --> 0:15:18,720
He is the King's nephew.

138
0:15:18,720 --> 0:15:20,160
And a brave fighter.

139
0:15:26,690 --> 0:15:29,330
You must be brave too now, Harry.

140
0:15:29,330 --> 0:15:32,330
You must not call me "boy".

141
0:15:32,330 --> 0:15:35,470
I will be a boy no longer.

142
0:15:36,540 --> 0:15:39,120
Husband, then.

143
0:15:56,210 --> 0:15:57,730
Husband, then.

144
0:15:58,060 --> 0:16:01,370
Husband, then.

145
0:16:02,260 --> 0:16:05,850
Fanshawe House near Oxford

146
0:16:11,140 --> 0:16:13,020
Do your worst.

147
0:16:14,140 --> 0:16:16,870
'So Fanshawe married Fanshawe.

148
0:16:18,020 --> 0:16:20,360
'Harry did not wed the house and land -

149
0:16:20,580 --> 0:16:22,200
'they were his already.

150
0:16:22,950 --> 0:16:24,800
'I did not wed the name -

151
0:16:24,800 --> 0:16:26,840
'that was mine already.

152
0:16:27,510 --> 0:16:30,040
'We married for love.'

153
0:16:33,760 --> 0:16:35,310
My serve, sir. Thank you.

154
0:16:35,310 --> 0:16:36,660
Mistress Lilburne.

155
0:16:36,660 --> 0:16:39,030
My Lady looks well.

156
0:16:39,060 --> 0:16:40,450
Lilburne?

157
0:16:40,450 --> 0:16:41,970
You have met before?

158
0:16:42,570 --> 0:16:44,460
Your wife was kind enough to spare a word

159
0:16:44,460 --> 0:16:45,830
on the day of your wedding, sir.

160
0:16:50,700 --> 0:16:54,870
My husband knows not that I am here. He would not beg.

161
0:16:54,870 --> 0:16:58,390
Indeed. For I have read his letter.

162
0:16:58,390 --> 0:17:01,670
As well as his pamphlet, The Work Of The Beast,

163
0:17:01,670 --> 0:17:03,160
which he was loving enough

164
0:17:03,160 --> 0:17:05,170
to send me as someone connected to His Majesty.

165
0:17:06,120 --> 0:17:08,560
And indeed he does not beg -

166
0:17:08,560 --> 0:17:13,080
he demands that I intercede on the side of "justice" and "liberty"

167
0:17:13,080 --> 0:17:14,580
Perhaps you have not read his pages.

168
0:17:14,580 --> 0:17:17,090
Sir, some of the pages are mine.

169
0:17:17,090 --> 0:17:21,170
John and I are of one mind and one flesh.

170
0:17:21,170 --> 0:17:23,410
Please, sit. You are weary.

171
0:17:23,410 --> 0:17:24,470
Indeed, Madam.

172
0:17:24,470 --> 0:17:25,780
For I have walked from London

173
0:17:25,780 --> 0:17:28,230
to speak to you only the truth, I swear.

174
0:17:28,230 --> 0:17:31,360
You have walked to no purpose, madam. She plays with "truth"

175
0:17:31,360 --> 0:17:34,590
as her husband plays with "liberty" and "justice".

176
0:17:35,430 --> 0:17:38,390
I came not to play at anything, sir,

177
0:17:38,390 --> 0:17:42,030
but to save my husband from a slow death in the Fleet Prison.

178
0:17:42,030 --> 0:17:43,470
For I know not how he will live

179
0:17:43,470 --> 0:17:45,330
except a voice is raised up for him,

180
0:17:45,480 --> 0:17:47,960
for I think the truest man in England.

181
0:17:47,960 --> 0:17:51,590
And though he will not beg, I will.

182
0:17:53,800 --> 0:17:56,940
His demand is only that the King let the Parliament sit

183
0:17:56,940 --> 0:17:59,800
so he may hear the grievances of his people.

184
0:18:05,060 --> 0:18:08,660
Husband? May we not hear...?        We?

185
0:18:11,060 --> 0:18:12,940
I fare you well, madam.

186
0:18:12,940 --> 0:18:14,180
You may go.

187
0:18:20,110 --> 0:18:23,670
You must never again interfere in matters you cannot understand.

188
0:18:32,640 --> 0:18:34,400
Give me that!

189
0:18:41,730 --> 0:18:43,850
Did you burn yourself?

190
0:18:46,860 --> 0:18:49,340
Why do you stare at me always?

191
0:18:51,980 --> 0:18:53,820
Wait.

192
0:18:55,110 --> 0:18:57,950
When you were sent here,

193
0:18:57,950 --> 0:19:00,470
Prince Rupert said you were a good man for a fight.

194
0:19:04,730 --> 0:19:07,760
I want you to take me to the Fleet Prison.

195
0:19:16,300 --> 0:19:18,340
How will the gaoler make his living

196
0:19:18,340 --> 0:19:20,920
unless he bring in wine and whores?

197
0:19:22,330 --> 0:19:24,590
I had thought there would be dungeons.

198
0:19:24,660 --> 0:19:27,820
There are, my lady. And there with Lilburne they'll sit,

199
0:19:27,820 --> 0:19:31,580
except the mob that reads his pamphlets came to burn the gaol down.

200
0:19:48,040 --> 0:19:49,980
I must see your face, madam.

201
0:19:50,720 --> 0:19:52,040
I cannot.

202
0:19:52,040 --> 0:19:55,290
We must have your face, madam, or your name.

203
0:20:06,260 --> 0:20:09,370
I come to be of service to you, Master Lilburne.

204
0:20:10,900 --> 0:20:12,580
How, madam?

205
0:20:12,580 --> 0:20:16,430
If you would but listen, my Lady will tell you.

206
0:20:20,910 --> 0:20:24,270
I wish to help you to His Majesty's forgiveness.

207
0:20:24,270 --> 0:20:28,280
He's a just, wise, and merciful man.

208
0:20:28,280 --> 0:20:30,320
Forgiveness?!

209
0:20:30,320 --> 0:20:34,000
For I think you are a sincere and godly man.

210
0:20:34,000 --> 0:20:36,060
But you do not know His Majesty's heart as I...

211
0:20:36,060 --> 0:20:37,640
He had me whipped at the cart's arse

212
0:20:37,640 --> 0:20:39,150
from Fleet Bridge to Westminster!

213
0:20:39,150 --> 0:20:40,550
Would you see the stripes?!

214
0:20:41,930 --> 0:20:43,490
John.

215
0:20:46,220 --> 0:20:48,680
Let me take to him some words of conciliation...

216
0:20:48,680 --> 0:20:49,820
Apologise?

217
0:20:49,820 --> 0:20:50,460
John.

218
0:20:50,460 --> 0:20:51,310
I?

219
0:20:51,310 --> 0:20:53,390
Her heart means well.

220
0:20:53,490 --> 0:20:55,020
Madam, I thank you,

221
0:20:55,020 --> 0:20:57,200
but I would rather have another 500 lashes

222
0:20:57,200 --> 0:20:59,490
ere I would kneel for forgiveness.

223
0:21:00,320 --> 0:21:02,930
The King must listen to the voice of reason in his Parliament

224
0:21:02,930 --> 0:21:05,240
and dismiss his fat-witted advisors!

225
0:21:06,400 --> 0:21:07,940
We shall not live like slaves!

226
0:21:07,980 --> 0:21:09,710
Nor shall we loll in our beds

227
0:21:09,710 --> 0:21:12,700
while he bring in an Irish Army or a Scotch Army to kill us!

228
0:21:12,700 --> 0:21:17,530
I... I know nothing of an Irish Army.

229
0:21:28,010 --> 0:21:29,110
Madam.

230
0:21:29,960 --> 0:21:32,230
My friend loves his crown of thorns,

231
0:21:32,230 --> 0:21:35,250
but God is at work in his honest heart.

232
0:21:36,320 --> 0:21:40,740
If I may not know your name, know mine.

233
0:21:40,740 --> 0:21:42,230
I am Thomas Rainsborough.

234
0:21:42,460 --> 0:21:44,510
The means to talk a King off his throne.

235
0:21:44,510 --> 0:21:45,720
King off his throne?

236
0:21:45,720 --> 0:21:47,640
Sirrah, I will not stay and quarrel with you

237
0:21:47,640 --> 0:21:49,950
for I see your life is a quarrel with itself.

238
0:21:50,400 --> 0:21:53,720
When the world has turned, may you find your true nature.

239
0:21:56,890 --> 0:22:00,410
How will the world be turned, sir?

240
0:22:00,410 --> 0:22:03,090
When the first is last and the last is first.

241
0:22:04,700 --> 0:22:06,460
And where shall I be on that day?

242
0:22:06,460 --> 0:22:08,820
You will be where you choose to be.

243
0:22:11,740 --> 0:22:13,220
Farewell, gentle Lady.

244
0:22:15,030 --> 0:22:18,230
Who was the other, who had no words but "John"?

245
0:22:18,230 --> 0:22:23,510
A godly man, and a good man for a committee, I am told.

246
0:22:23,510 --> 0:22:26,400
Sent from Cambridge to sit in the Commons.

247
0:22:31,920 --> 0:22:35,130
Now that at last the King permits us to sit,

248
0:22:35,130 --> 0:22:39,770
let my first words in this new House be on injustice.

249
0:22:41,330 --> 0:22:43,850
Hath not His Majesty sworn,

250
0:22:43,850 --> 0:22:47,780
not to deny to any man either justice or right?

251
0:22:47,780 --> 0:22:52,740
Then where is the justice for John Lilburne?

252
0:22:52,740 --> 0:22:55,310
That rots still in the Fleet

253
0:22:55,310 --> 0:22:57,190
by a sentence most illegal,

254
0:22:57,190 --> 0:23:00,310
against the liberty of the subject,

255
0:23:00,310 --> 0:23:05,240
bloody, wicked, barbarous and tyrannical?!

256
0:23:05,240 --> 0:23:08,120
Now we sit, we must listen to these voices

257
0:23:08,120 --> 0:23:10,500
or they will drown out our proceedings.

258
0:23:12,200 --> 0:23:13,620
I, Oliver Cromwell,

259
0:23:13,620 --> 0:23:16,500
petition this House that by its own authority

260
0:23:16,500 --> 0:23:19,930
it orders the immediate release of Honest John Lilburne!

261
0:23:26,420 --> 0:23:28,340
You waste no words.

262
0:23:30,700 --> 0:23:32,620
What would you have me say?

263
0:23:34,100 --> 0:23:35,670
Did you think me...

264
0:23:37,110 --> 0:23:38,550
"fat-witted"?

265
0:23:40,510 --> 0:23:42,230
Your journey was wasted.

266
0:23:44,350 --> 0:23:47,720
You thought to bring a prize home for your husband, did you not?

267
0:23:47,720 --> 0:23:49,280
He must not know.

268
0:23:50,880 --> 0:23:52,640
I will bring in your bags, my Lady.

269
0:23:55,050 --> 0:23:57,930
What thought you on Master Rainsborough?

270
0:23:57,930 --> 0:24:00,570
If my Lady was a dinner,

271
0:24:00,570 --> 0:24:02,450
he would lick the plate clean.

272
0:24:06,300 --> 0:24:07,500
No more?

273
0:24:09,940 --> 0:24:11,460
He sees into men's hearts.

274
0:24:13,140 --> 0:24:15,830
"The world to turn."

275
0:24:15,830 --> 0:24:18,990
How may that be, think you?

276
0:24:18,990 --> 0:24:20,430
He dreams.

277
0:24:22,070 --> 0:24:25,480
On a world where no man needs a King to govern him.

278
0:24:25,480 --> 0:24:30,760
And perhaps, no woman her husband to govern her.

279
0:24:32,920 --> 0:24:34,970
Shall I bring in your bags, my Lady?

280
0:24:34,970 --> 0:24:36,650
Where got you those cuts?

281
0:24:40,170 --> 0:24:41,210
Fighting.

282
0:24:41,210 --> 0:24:42,410
Where?

283
0:24:42,410 --> 0:24:44,290
Wherever there are wages.

284
0:24:44,290 --> 0:24:46,660
Why are you here, Sexby?

285
0:24:46,660 --> 0:24:49,700
Why do you draw my water and carry logs to my fire?

286
0:24:54,630 --> 0:24:56,350
I am waiting, my Lady.

287
0:25:00,350 --> 0:25:02,550
For what?

288
0:25:02,550 --> 0:25:04,800
For the killing to start.

289
0:25:06,960 --> 0:25:08,760
Killing?

290
0:25:10,800 --> 0:25:13,920
One side will draw a sword.

291
0:25:13,920 --> 0:25:16,050
It is the world.

292
0:25:19,370 --> 0:25:22,010
Your horse waits on its straw.

293
0:25:24,050 --> 0:25:26,300
And my Lord waits on you.

294
0:25:32,300 --> 0:25:35,510
You are returned.

295
0:25:35,510 --> 0:25:38,110
How fares your friend?

296
0:25:38,110 --> 0:25:40,470
She is...

297
0:25:40,470 --> 0:25:43,110
She is much recovered, sir.

298
0:25:46,960 --> 0:25:49,200
Cover yourself, sirrah.

299
0:26:00,050 --> 0:26:02,410
Harry.

300
0:26:09,180 --> 0:26:11,100
My thoughts are with His Majesty.

301
0:26:13,740 --> 0:26:16,270
A mob, urged on by traitors in the Parliament,

302
0:26:16,270 --> 0:26:19,750
has forced the release of Lilburne. This is anarchy.

303
0:26:19,750 --> 0:26:21,390
Harry, do you not think that these grievances...?

304
0:26:21,390 --> 0:26:23,550
They have no grievances.

305
0:26:23,550 --> 0:26:26,400
He is the King.

306
0:26:26,400 --> 0:26:28,040
They are his subjects.

307
0:26:28,040 --> 0:26:29,640
Of course, but might there not be...

308
0:26:29,640 --> 0:26:31,960
It is not for you to think about.

309
0:26:34,040 --> 0:26:36,410
We will go to London tomorrow.

310
0:26:36,410 --> 0:26:39,890
His Majesty has commanded the House to give up five old dogs

311
0:26:39,890 --> 0:26:42,090
that have bitten him these ten years.

312
0:26:42,090 --> 0:26:44,620
They still deny the King his right to rule.

313
0:26:44,620 --> 0:26:46,780
They're traitors, the House must surrender them.

314
0:26:46,780 --> 0:26:49,020
And what if they refuse?

315
0:26:50,220 --> 0:26:51,580
He will seize them.

316
0:26:53,180 --> 0:26:54,220
He will enter their Chamber?

317
0:26:54,220 --> 0:26:55,390
It is his parliament.

318
0:26:55,390 --> 0:26:56,150
But to use force against...

319
0:26:56,150 --> 0:26:58,710
It is not for you to think about.

320
0:27:00,350 --> 0:27:02,190
Harry.

321
0:27:03,630 --> 0:27:06,800
Will you not come to me tonight?

322
0:27:06,800 --> 0:27:08,240
Aye.

323
0:27:10,040 --> 0:27:11,640
If you will be silent.

324
0:28:22,860 --> 0:28:23,820
Why do men mock me?

325
0:28:30,500 --> 0:28:32,340
Who mocks you, Harry?

326
0:28:36,070 --> 0:28:38,030
Even on my wedding day, I was mocked.

327
0:28:39,070 --> 0:28:40,790
"A pleasure for all men."

328
0:28:40,790 --> 0:28:41,950
What?

329
0:28:45,640 --> 0:28:46,760
Are you a whore, madam?

330
0:28:54,330 --> 0:28:57,650
I'm what you see, Harry. I'm what you know me to be.

331
0:28:57,650 --> 0:28:59,570
Aye...

332
0:28:59,570 --> 0:29:01,370
by day.

333
0:29:04,140 --> 0:29:05,820
But by night, what are you?

334
0:29:07,820 --> 0:29:10,260
When the Devil came to you...

335
0:29:10,260 --> 0:29:11,780
That you did tell me as a boy.

336
0:29:11,780 --> 0:29:12,830
Sir?

337
0:29:12,830 --> 0:29:15,310
Aye, Satan, with his tongue unfurled.

338
0:29:15,310 --> 0:29:16,950
I was a girl, I...

339
0:29:16,950 --> 0:29:18,070
Did he enter you?

340
0:29:19,150 --> 0:29:20,190
What?!

341
0:29:20,190 --> 0:29:23,040
Then wherefrom these noises at night?

342
0:29:27,360 --> 0:29:28,880
Harry, why do we fight?

343
0:29:30,480 --> 0:29:33,330
Are we not Harry and Angelica,

344
0:29:33,330 --> 0:29:35,050
best of friends?

345
0:29:36,290 --> 0:29:39,030
Boy, again.

346
0:29:50,100 --> 0:29:52,060
Do you smell it?

347
0:29:54,430 --> 0:29:56,710
It's on the wind.

348
0:30:01,910 --> 0:30:04,320
The House refuses.

349
0:30:05,920 --> 0:30:09,240
I will be master of my enemies.

350
0:30:10,410 --> 0:30:11,890
Follow me!

351
0:30:14,320 --> 0:30:16,600
Do not draw your sword...

352
0:30:16,600 --> 0:30:19,600
unless you be certain of the day.

353
0:30:27,930 --> 0:30:31,250
The King comes with armed men.

354
0:30:32,700 --> 0:30:34,940
Gentlemen, a barge awaits you at the Watergate.

355
0:30:37,860 --> 0:30:40,980
Let them go, quickly.

356
0:30:40,980 --> 0:30:42,910
If the King takes them, he is strong.

357
0:30:42,910 --> 0:30:44,630
If he fails to take them, he is weak.

358
0:30:48,430 --> 0:30:50,870
Do not attack your enemy's house...

359
0:30:53,200 --> 0:30:54,840
..if he be gone from it.

360
0:31:01,900 --> 0:31:04,500
I had not thought he would do this, Thomas.

361
0:31:18,350 --> 0:31:21,280
Mr Speaker, I must for a time make bold with your chair.

362
0:31:25,640 --> 0:31:28,080
Five of your members are charged with treason.

363
0:31:28,080 --> 0:31:30,210
You will point them out to me.

364
0:31:35,570 --> 0:31:37,370
Sire, it is not my part to see

365
0:31:37,370 --> 0:31:40,140
or speak anything but as this House desires me.

366
0:31:40,140 --> 0:31:45,060
Hear, hear!

367
0:31:57,710 --> 0:31:59,120
No matter.

368
0:32:02,320 --> 0:32:04,080
My eyes are as good as another's.

369
0:32:06,000 --> 0:32:09,650
I can see all my birds have... flown.

370
0:32:25,980 --> 0:32:26,940
Know the hour.

371
0:32:29,310 --> 0:32:32,270
And the minute.

372
0:32:32,270 --> 0:32:33,990
And the second.

373
0:32:42,360 --> 0:32:43,680
It's lost.

374
0:32:43,680 --> 0:32:46,000
Harry, what is lost?

375
0:32:46,000 --> 0:32:48,040
London is lost.

376
0:32:50,050 --> 0:32:52,090
(SHE SPEAKS IN FRENCH)

377
0:32:52,090 --> 0:32:55,250
We leave London as soon as it is dark.

378
0:32:55,250 --> 0:32:57,610
The apprentice bands are sacking houses.

379
0:32:57,610 --> 0:33:00,420
The militia is out and armed.

380
0:33:00,420 --> 0:33:03,020
They come here to defend their Parliament.

381
0:33:06,540 --> 0:33:08,020
Majesty.

382
0:33:08,020 --> 0:33:11,070
My dear, sweet girl, you must not trouble yourself.

383
0:33:11,070 --> 0:33:13,710
Sire, there are matters Your Majesty may not fully understand.

384
0:33:13,710 --> 0:33:14,950
Angelica.

385
0:33:14,950 --> 0:33:17,390
Concerning the Parliament men.

386
0:33:20,240 --> 0:33:22,880
I think they need not be your enemies, Your Majesty.

387
0:33:24,480 --> 0:33:26,200
There has been a mistake.

388
0:33:28,810 --> 0:33:29,770
A mistake?

389
0:33:35,610 --> 0:33:38,740
I am...mistook?

390
0:33:40,620 --> 0:33:45,220
A thousand apologies, Your Majesty. Her mind is wild, still.

391
0:33:46,220 --> 0:33:47,380
Leave us.

392
0:33:52,310 --> 0:33:53,710
(SHE SPEAKS IN FRENCH)

393
0:33:59,000 --> 0:34:02,880
Wa...wa...wa...

394
0:34:04,640 --> 0:34:06,040
War.

395
0:34:13,370 --> 0:34:17,160
Edge Hill  Kineton 1642

396
0:34:33,230 --> 0:34:34,950
The day depends on us!

397
0:34:34,950 --> 0:34:37,810
And we charge!

398
0:35:33,770 --> 0:35:35,210
Where's your honour, Sexby?

399
0:35:36,930 --> 0:35:37,890
Where are your men?

400
0:35:39,060 --> 0:35:41,860
Half way to Kineton, seeking you, sir.

401
0:35:41,860 --> 0:35:43,820
Follow me.

402
0:35:43,820 --> 0:35:46,940
You lost your men, you seek them out.

403
0:35:46,940 --> 0:35:49,230
You're under my command, Sexby.

404
0:35:53,390 --> 0:35:54,870
I don't take orders from boys.

405
0:35:57,590 --> 0:35:58,590
How came you by that?

406
0:36:01,440 --> 0:36:02,600
Give it to me.

407
0:36:07,240 --> 0:36:08,930
Take it from me.

408
0:36:17,050 --> 0:36:18,450
I can have you shot for this.

409
0:36:24,620 --> 0:36:28,020
Then why should I fight for you or your king?

410
0:36:28,020 --> 0:36:29,990
Come and fight me on the battlefield.

411
0:36:51,260 --> 0:36:53,220
Hold fast, John!

412
0:36:54,660 --> 0:36:56,300
Hold fast!

413
0:37:20,490 --> 0:37:22,410
Welcome to paradise, sir!

414
0:37:22,410 --> 0:37:24,130
For liberty and justice!

415
0:37:29,060 --> 0:37:32,020
I see your world is turning!Sir

416
0:37:47,030 --> 0:37:49,000
Sexby!

417
0:37:53,000 --> 0:37:54,160
Traitor!

418
0:39:31,540 --> 0:39:32,980
He's here, Thomas.

419
0:39:35,900 --> 0:39:38,660
The night has frozen his wounds.

420
0:39:38,660 --> 0:39:40,110
Yet he breathes.

421
0:39:41,790 --> 0:39:43,670
Grab his legs...

422
0:39:49,870 --> 0:39:51,820
Grab his legs...

423
0:39:54,190 --> 0:39:56,860
Both armies gave thanks to the same god

424
0:39:56,860 --> 0:39:58,280
for the same victory.

425
0:39:58,390 --> 0:40:01,680
And in truth, the fight at Kineton settled nothing at all.

426
0:40:01,680 --> 0:40:03,560
It was only the beginning.

427
0:40:03,560 --> 0:40:04,560
As the seasons turned,

428
0:40:04,560 --> 0:40:08,500
ever more blood was spilled in all corners of the land.

429
0:40:11,680 --> 0:40:15,180
Croyland Abbey,The Fens Christmas Day 1643

430
0:40:21,420 --> 0:40:23,420
You thought right, Thomas.

431
0:40:23,420 --> 0:40:27,340
They look not for this, not come by floodwater.

432
0:40:27,340 --> 0:40:29,870
Nor on this day, Oliver.

433
0:40:36,990 --> 0:40:39,400
Make ready the guns, Edward.

434
0:40:40,560 --> 0:40:42,800
Thomas. Must there truly be no warning?

435
0:40:42,800 --> 0:40:44,760
None.

436
0:40:44,760 --> 0:40:47,160
We are too few to storm them.

437
0:40:47,160 --> 0:40:49,410
Women and children...

438
0:40:49,410 --> 0:40:53,050
Aye. They must feel terror in their hearts.

439
0:41:03,140 --> 0:41:05,060
Fire the first gun.

440
0:41:05,060 --> 0:41:08,100
Fire the first gun and reload.

441
0:41:17,350 --> 0:41:19,000
Fire the second.

442
0:41:19,000 --> 0:41:22,120
Fire the second gun and reload.

443
0:41:37,650 --> 0:41:38,980
We are ready, sir.

444
0:41:44,620 --> 0:41:46,540
Hold.

445
0:41:54,590 --> 0:41:56,870
Thomas, surely they see how few we are.

446
0:41:56,870 --> 0:41:59,600
All that matter's is this man's spirit.

447
0:41:59,600 --> 0:42:02,840
If I break it, your men need not draw their swords.

448
0:42:02,840 --> 0:42:05,200
Is this how men fight, sir?

449
0:42:05,200 --> 0:42:08,200
Hear this. God sent these floods to trap you.

450
0:42:08,200 --> 0:42:10,600
Now he sends you Rainsborough and Cromwell,

451
0:42:10,600 --> 0:42:11,910
like Joshua and Gideon,

452
0:42:11,910 --> 0:42:13,790
to drown you in fire and blood.

453
0:42:13,790 --> 0:42:16,810
You cannot withstand us. We have 20 cannon.

454
0:42:16,810 --> 0:42:18,610
Our duty is clear, sirs.

455
0:42:18,610 --> 0:42:20,690
You will command the surrender now.

456
0:42:20,690 --> 0:42:22,180
If you do, you may retreat,

457
0:42:22,180 --> 0:42:23,660
bag and baggage when the waters go.

458
0:42:23,700 --> 0:42:24,220
Sirs...

459
0:42:24,220 --> 0:42:26,620
Else your walls will suffer more ordnance.

460
0:42:26,620 --> 0:42:29,340
My engineers will dig beneath you

461
0:42:29,340 --> 0:42:31,370
and we will blow you all to atoms.

462
0:42:31,710 --> 0:42:33,630
Your men will receive no quarter.

463
0:42:33,630 --> 0:42:36,870
Those that breathe will go to the Indies as slaves.

464
0:42:36,870 --> 0:42:39,160
Decide now.

465
0:42:50,410 --> 0:42:52,810
Your time is borrowed, sir.

466
0:43:02,300 --> 0:43:06,610
Will you grant us what remains of this blessed day to pray together

467
0:43:06,610 --> 0:43:07,980
Colonel Rainsborough?

468
0:43:07,980 --> 0:43:09,670
No, sir.

469
0:43:09,670 --> 0:43:14,030
You blaspheme by giving the Son of God a birthday party.

470
0:43:14,030 --> 0:43:16,110
This is a day like any other.

471
0:44:08,080 --> 0:44:10,700
Angelica, the King asks me to tell you

472
0:44:10,700 --> 0:44:13,280
he has recalled Harry from the West Country.

473
0:44:13,810 --> 0:44:16,730
Then I can go to Fanshawe again?

474
0:44:16,730 --> 0:44:19,620
No, no, child. You are to wait till Harry sends for you.

475
0:44:38,230 --> 0:44:39,760
Bring him in.

476
0:44:40,920 --> 0:44:42,360
Away!

477
0:44:54,690 --> 0:44:56,330
Stand.

478
0:44:59,300 --> 0:45:01,100
Well, speak.

479
0:45:01,100 --> 0:45:04,350
Sire, on Christmas Day just gone,

480
0:45:04,350 --> 0:45:07,060
the Abbey at Croyland was taken.

481
0:45:08,460 --> 0:45:09,910
Taken?

482
0:45:11,830 --> 0:45:13,670
How, taken?

483
0:45:13,670 --> 0:45:16,190
Surrendered, sire.

484
0:45:16,190 --> 0:45:19,680
To Colonels Cromwell and Rainsborough.

485
0:45:19,680 --> 0:45:22,120
Sire, we could not have resisted them.

486
0:45:22,120 --> 0:45:24,600
Surrendered?

487
0:45:24,600 --> 0:45:26,840
Without...a fight?

488
0:45:29,530 --> 0:45:30,850
Well...

489
0:45:30,850 --> 0:45:34,970
You, sir, will never command men hereafter.

490
0:45:36,530 --> 0:45:39,510
It seems now my enemies need only look upon my power

491
0:45:39,510 --> 0:45:40,760
and it takes to its heels.

492
0:45:42,780 --> 0:45:45,500
I must tell you all,

493
0:45:45,500 --> 0:45:48,830
while they have more stomach than we have for the fight,

494
0:45:48,830 --> 0:45:50,790
none of us will see London ever again.

495
0:46:07,520 --> 0:46:09,010
Save yourself, madam!

496
0:46:13,570 --> 0:46:16,290
What's going on?         Go, go!

497
0:46:19,700 --> 0:46:20,900
Find them.

498
0:46:22,100 --> 0:46:23,700
You'll watch them hang.

499
0:46:25,460 --> 0:46:27,080
Slowly.

500
0:46:28,620 --> 0:46:30,190
You were not...

501
0:46:31,550 --> 0:46:32,710
..touched?

502
0:46:34,950 --> 0:46:37,910
I was never more glad to see you.

503
0:46:37,910 --> 0:46:41,640
My letter was clear. You were to wait to be brought out.

504
0:46:41,640 --> 0:46:42,920
I thought I was...

505
0:46:42,920 --> 0:46:43,960
You thought?

506
0:46:45,640 --> 0:46:48,440
You thought to pay no heed to my wishes.

507
0:46:48,440 --> 0:46:51,210
Men are dead because you thought.

508
0:46:54,170 --> 0:46:55,610
I was wrong.

509
0:46:58,450 --> 0:47:01,020
It was done because...

510
0:47:01,020 --> 0:47:03,620
I missed my friend Harry.

511
0:47:03,620 --> 0:47:05,300
Did he not miss me?

512
0:47:07,420 --> 0:47:09,030
You reach for your boy.

513
0:47:10,430 --> 0:47:12,670
You will not find him again.

514
0:47:15,670 --> 0:47:18,510
I am Colonel Harry Fanshawe.

515
0:47:24,720 --> 0:47:26,680
I am yours to command, Colonel.

516
0:47:36,170 --> 0:47:38,450
Amen.

517
0:47:38,450 --> 0:47:39,900
Amen.

518
0:47:45,860 --> 0:47:47,940
Let down your hair.

519
0:48:00,880 --> 0:48:02,400
Show yourself to me.

520
0:48:23,780 --> 0:48:26,180
Oh, my husband...

521
0:48:31,270 --> 0:48:33,790
My true, brave husband.

522
0:48:33,790 --> 0:48:36,110
You are my master.

523
0:48:36,110 --> 0:48:37,550
I am yours.

524
0:48:38,670 --> 0:48:39,800
My true...

525
0:48:39,800 --> 0:48:41,000
Madam!

526
0:48:42,510 --> 0:48:45,640
These are the words of the whores in my soldiers' camps!

527
0:48:50,210 --> 0:48:51,730
Then, Harry...

528
0:48:53,450 --> 0:48:55,850
..I commend to you to your soldiers...

529
0:48:57,410 --> 0:48:59,700
..and your soldiers to their whores.

530
0:49:03,540 --> 0:49:07,540
Where you may command, I will ever be your dutiful wife.

531
0:49:07,540 --> 0:49:10,150
Where you may not, I can be nothing but what I am.

532
0:49:16,820 --> 0:49:18,500
Parliamentary Camp Newbury October 1644

533
0:49:19,520 --> 0:49:21,680
Horses for the Earl of Manchester.

534
0:49:21,680 --> 0:49:24,420
Does the Commander-in-Chief know our plans, General?

535
0:49:24,420 --> 0:49:26,260
The King marches on us, my lord.

536
0:49:26,880 --> 0:49:29,270
I have a plan to assault his guns at first peep,

537
0:49:29,270 --> 0:49:31,160
from behind his own lines.

538
0:49:32,500 --> 0:49:35,220
We shall devise some signal for your lordship

539
0:49:35,220 --> 0:49:37,140
when it is time to take to the field.

540
0:49:37,170 --> 0:49:40,900
I will not need your signal, Colonel Rainsborough,

541
0:49:40,900 --> 0:49:42,550
and I did not loll asleep, General,

542
0:49:42,550 --> 0:49:44,580
when you spoke your plans earlier.

543
0:49:45,060 --> 0:49:47,340
I believe the King will not press the fight.

544
0:49:47,340 --> 0:49:49,910
Let the winter come on. Let time heal our wounds.

545
0:49:49,910 --> 0:49:53,550
For myself, I'd march to Oxford and pull him from his lair.

546
0:49:53,550 --> 0:49:54,390
Would not you, General?

547
0:49:54,390 --> 0:49:57,190
Gentlemen, we must consider what we do.

548
0:49:57,190 --> 0:50:00,920
If we fight the King a hundred times and we beat him 99 times

549
0:50:00,920 --> 0:50:02,760
he will be King still.

550
0:50:02,800 --> 0:50:06,080
But if he beat us but once, we shall be hanged.

551
0:50:06,080 --> 0:50:07,710
We shall lose our estates.

552
0:50:07,760 --> 0:50:10,730
Sir, I have none to lose.

553
0:50:10,730 --> 0:50:12,220
My lord, if this be so,

554
0:50:12,220 --> 0:50:14,210
then why did we take up arms at first?

555
0:50:15,370 --> 0:50:19,140
Then let us make peace, on any terms, be it never so base.

556
0:50:27,100 --> 0:50:29,590
Are your men in readiness, then?

557
0:50:29,590 --> 0:50:31,430
Armed without and within, my lord.

558
0:50:33,150 --> 0:50:35,110
I'm told...

559
0:50:35,110 --> 0:50:37,180
that none of your officers are men of estate,

560
0:50:37,180 --> 0:50:38,610
but such as are common men.

561
0:50:39,560 --> 0:50:41,160
Yet godly and precious, sir.

562
0:50:41,160 --> 0:50:43,840
They are in this quarrel for their conscience' sake,

563
0:50:43,840 --> 0:50:45,030
not for pay.

564
0:50:47,360 --> 0:50:49,330
I pray you look them over.

565
0:50:51,290 --> 0:50:52,610
The day draws on.

566
0:50:52,610 --> 0:50:54,050
I pray you.

567
0:50:54,050 --> 0:50:57,050
For most surely it would raise their spirits even higher

568
0:50:57,050 --> 0:50:59,820
to look upon the face of their Commander-in-Chief.

569
0:51:02,900 --> 0:51:04,870
For what is our purpose in this fight,

570
0:51:04,870 --> 0:51:08,030
but to rid England of the thieving abuses of privilege

571
0:51:08,060 --> 0:51:11,590
and to take back our common inheritance?

572
0:51:11,590 --> 0:51:16,630
A rich man is but a man who is a burden on to other men.

573
0:51:18,430 --> 0:51:20,960
Even an earl is but a man.

574
0:51:20,960 --> 0:51:23,200
Who is this?

575
0:51:23,200 --> 0:51:24,610
Major Lilburne,

576
0:51:24,610 --> 0:51:26,470
that did fight most desperately at Kineton

577
0:51:26,470 --> 0:51:28,930
and in our late victory at Marston field.

578
0:51:29,010 --> 0:51:33,010
Lilburne - the man who would have us all level.

579
0:51:34,530 --> 0:51:36,250
Will he not bow?

580
0:51:36,250 --> 0:51:40,260
John...will you not bow to his lordship?

581
0:51:41,740 --> 0:51:45,860
Bow, sir, and all will be well.

582
0:51:45,860 --> 0:51:47,220
All will not be well in this land

583
0:51:47,220 --> 0:51:51,840
until the Earl of Manchester is but plain Mr Montague.

584
0:51:52,990 --> 0:51:54,150
You will hang, sir!

585
0:51:56,790 --> 0:52:00,440
He will not hang. I will be hanged first.

586
0:52:00,440 --> 0:52:02,800
Edward!         My lord.

587
0:52:04,920 --> 0:52:06,360
Perhaps the earl did not see

588
0:52:06,360 --> 0:52:08,840
how bravely this man fought at Marston.

589
0:52:09,530 --> 0:52:10,910
For it was somewhat dark

590
0:52:10,910 --> 0:52:12,450
before he entered the field of battle himself.

591
0:52:12,450 --> 0:52:15,330
You, sir, are another Leveller!

592
0:52:15,330 --> 0:52:18,410
And I will have no Levellers in my command!

593
0:52:21,620 --> 0:52:23,380
Bow, or I'll hang you myself.

594
0:52:40,880 --> 0:52:42,680
Edward, you were too hot.

595
0:52:42,680 --> 0:52:45,400
But I'll speak to the earl and he will relent.

596
0:52:45,400 --> 0:52:48,440
Do not spend your breath.

597
0:52:48,440 --> 0:52:50,690
I will fight for this parliament no more.

598
0:52:50,690 --> 0:52:51,540
Where is liberty

599
0:52:51,540 --> 0:52:54,440
when Freeborn John must bow to a hog in armour?

600
0:52:56,250 --> 0:52:57,690
Fare you well.

601
0:53:04,540 --> 0:53:05,590
He spoke the truth.

602
0:53:07,170 --> 0:53:09,080
There are too many like Mr Montague that

603
0:53:09,080 --> 0:53:11,520
have too much to lose by our victory.

604
0:53:14,670 --> 0:53:15,830
Goodnight.

605
0:53:17,790 --> 0:53:20,000
You were right, Thomas.

606
0:53:20,000 --> 0:53:22,760
Soon we must move towards Oxford and the King's lair.

607
0:53:22,760 --> 0:53:25,040
And in our way, there are some great houses

608
0:53:25,040 --> 0:53:25,850
that we must secure.

609
0:53:26,280 --> 0:53:28,440
Nay, that you must secure.

610
0:54:15,930 --> 0:54:18,820
Colonel Fanshawe. I am Colonel Thomas Rainsborough.

611
0:54:18,820 --> 0:54:20,340
I know you who you are.

612
0:54:20,340 --> 0:54:23,620
I will accept no bargain nor hear no threats from you.

613
0:54:23,620 --> 0:54:25,090
Do your worst.

614
0:54:26,080 --> 0:54:28,570
My lady and her women will leave within the hour.

615
0:54:28,600 --> 0:54:29,630
So be it.

616
0:54:32,590 --> 0:54:34,230
My wife.

617
0:54:37,550 --> 0:54:39,850
I will write you a pass to Oxford, my lady.

618
0:54:39,850 --> 0:54:41,000
We are busy in the county.

619
0:54:41,000 --> 0:54:42,480
I will need no pass, sir.

620
0:54:43,600 --> 0:54:46,080
This is the house that I was born in.

621
0:54:47,720 --> 0:54:48,790
If you wish to take it from us,

622
0:54:48,790 --> 0:54:50,930
you will wade through blood to do it.

623
0:54:51,810 --> 0:54:54,810
This is not Croyland Abbey.

624
0:54:54,810 --> 0:54:56,970
Is this not so, my lord?

625
0:54:56,970 --> 0:54:59,620
The ladies will be ready within the hour.

626
0:54:59,620 --> 0:55:01,460
Husband?

627
0:55:01,460 --> 0:55:02,660
Madam.

628
0:55:02,660 --> 0:55:06,100
Hear your husband, for I mean to do my duty here.

629
0:55:06,100 --> 0:55:08,870
And I mine...sir.

630
0:55:10,550 --> 0:55:11,510
You will leave, madam!

631
0:55:11,510 --> 0:55:12,590
I will not, sir.

632
0:55:14,070 --> 0:55:18,430
Angelica, you are the dearest creature in the world to me...

633
0:55:18,430 --> 0:55:20,040
Then let me stand beside you.

634
0:55:20,040 --> 0:55:21,490
Rainsborough has never failed in a siege.

635
0:55:21,490 --> 0:55:23,480
He will destroy the house and all in it.

636
0:55:24,240 --> 0:55:25,760
Then where else should I be?

637
0:55:27,760 --> 0:55:30,410
I will stay at all costs.

638
0:55:30,410 --> 0:55:32,810
And die by your side.

639
0:55:37,210 --> 0:55:38,820
Then all is lost.

640
0:55:41,740 --> 0:55:43,220
Utterly lost.

641
0:56:19,780 --> 0:56:20,980
Your Majesty...

642
0:56:20,980 --> 0:56:22,540
Be silent.

643
0:56:25,980 --> 0:56:28,100
You should have obeyed your husband.

644
0:56:30,350 --> 0:56:32,150
And you, sir...

645
0:56:33,830 --> 0:56:36,070
..you should have subdued your wife.

646
0:56:39,010 --> 0:56:42,170
Stay in Oxford if you will, madam,

647
0:56:42,600 --> 0:56:47,240
but expect nothing from the Queen's household evermore.

648
0:56:48,480 --> 0:56:50,380
I will accept any commission from Your Majesty,

649
0:56:50,380 --> 0:56:53,000
however base or of low rank...

650
0:56:53,000 --> 0:56:53,950
No, sir.

651
0:56:56,970 --> 0:57:00,940
You will prepare yourself... to meet God.

652
0:57:18,390 --> 0:57:19,960
Your Majesty...?

653
0:57:22,520 --> 0:57:27,200
He forgiveth and absolveth them that truly repent,

654
0:57:27,200 --> 0:57:30,610
so that at the last, we may come to his eternal joy...

655
0:57:32,210 --> 0:57:34,730
..through Jesus Christ Our Lord.

656
0:57:34,730 --> 0:57:36,250
Amen.

657
0:57:39,500 --> 0:57:42,220
You must say "amen".

658
0:57:43,820 --> 0:57:45,260
Amen.

659
0:57:48,100 --> 0:57:50,470
Surely the King does this only to fright me?

660
0:57:50,470 --> 0:57:51,590
Halt!

661
0:57:51,590 --> 0:57:53,510
Stand left!

662
0:57:53,510 --> 0:57:55,350
Where is my wife?

663
0:58:00,200 --> 0:58:01,640
Harry!

664
0:58:06,120 --> 0:58:07,600
Be brief, madam.

665
0:58:12,810 --> 0:58:15,210
Farewell, sweet friend.

666
0:58:25,300 --> 0:58:27,740
I have done this, Harry.

667
0:58:29,470 --> 0:58:31,490
I have done this!

668
0:58:32,820 --> 0:58:34,540
Remember me.

669
0:58:35,070 --> 0:58:36,730
Remember your boy...

670
0:58:38,190 --> 0:58:41,800
who loved his sweet playfellow more than life.

671
0:58:45,800 --> 0:58:48,080
Pray to God for me, Angelica.

672
0:58:50,290 --> 0:58:52,210
Pray to God for me, Angelica.

673
0:59:04,470 --> 0:59:06,090
Please God...

674
0:59:16,870 --> 0:59:18,570
Take aim...

675
0:59:19,040 --> 0:59:22,600
Please, God, if you hear me, I beg you...

676
0:59:26,240 --> 0:59:27,460
Fire!
