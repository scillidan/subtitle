1
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,590
我听说 大号避孕套基本上
I heard Magnum condoms are basically

2
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,720
和普通避孕套尺寸一样
the same size as regular condoms.

3
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,460
嗯嗯
Mmm-mmm.

4
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,070
这让你思考
Which makes you think, like,

5
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,590
我们还相信了什么 仅仅因为营销
what else do we believe just because of marketing?

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,730
就像 如果你从小
Like, if you grew up being told

7
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,380
就被告知摩门经是假的
the Book of Mormon is fake,

8
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,250
你可能会相信它是假的 因为
you'd probably believe it was fake 'cause

9
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,120
别人就是这么告诉你的
that's what you were told.

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,990
不 大号避孕套很大
No, Magnums are huge.

11
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,880
我姐姐说她前夫的阴茎大得吓人
My sister said her ex-husband had a scary big peen,

12
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,790
大得吓人 他们必须戴大号避孕套
like, frighteningly big, and they had to wear Magnums.

13
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,620
听起来像是编造的
Sounds made up.

14
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,740
象鼻
Elephant trunk.

15
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,580
对 她就是这么叫的
Yup. That's what she would call it.

16
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,500
我当时在看一个视频
I was watching this video,

17
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,100
我不确定是在哪里看到的
I'm not sure where I saw it.

18
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,840
是两个人在做爱
It was these two people having intercourse,

19
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,290
性交
um, sexual intercourse,

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,890
做爱 然后  有一个摄影师在拍他们
sex, and, uh, and a cameraman filming them.

21
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,980
像业余色情片 那种类型的
Like an amateur porno... nography type thing?

22
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,810
视频里的女孩大声呻吟
Um, and the girl in the video was moaning loudly,

23
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,640
我想 在那种视频里很典型
as in typical, I assume, in that kind of video.

24
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,730
只是尖叫
Just screaming.

25
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,620
然后 突然间
And then, all of a sudden,

26
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,510
在镜头外 在走廊里
off camera, in the hallway,

27
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,260
你听到一个女士隔着墙大喊
you hear this lady yell, through the wall,

28
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,830
“我们能听到你”
"We can hear you!"

29
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,650
然后这对夫妇停止了做爱
And the couple stop sex-ing.

30
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:56,750
他们脸上尴尬和恐惧的表情
And the look of embarrassment and horror on their faces

31
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,840
太痛苦了
was so painful.

32
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,620
那个色情片女主角 就像
And the porno-girl who's, like,

33
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,230
从后面被进入 她说了一些挑衅的话 比如
taking it from behind-ish, says something defiant, like,

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,370
“好啊” 小声地说
"Good!" under her breath,

35
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,280
但你可以看到她的灵魂
but you can literally see her soul

36
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,110
当时就被吸走了
being sucked out of her body, right then and there.

37
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,200
她所有的尊严都消失了
All of her dignity gone,

38
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,200
好像第一次意识到 比如
as if realizing for the first time, like,

39
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,590
“哇 这就是我的生活
"Wow, this is my life,

40
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,560
“我在镜头前和一个陌生人做爱 为了钱”
"I'm f-ing a stranger on camera for money."

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,650
我只是想
And I just thought,

42
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,080
“哇 这真的很令人心酸”
"Like, wow, that is really poignant."

43
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,910
因为 就像 在那一刻
Because, like, in that moment,

44
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,310
我就像 “是的”
I was like, "Yeah."

45
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,940
上帝是真的
God's real.

46
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,570
我们有灵魂
We have souls.

47
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,320
这是神圣的确认
It's divine confirmation.

48
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,140
你经常看
Do you watch a lot of...

49
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,150
不 我不看 不
No! I do not! No.

50
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,890

54
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,240

55
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,810
哦 我希望一切顺利
Oh, I hope this goes well.

56
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,560
我知道这不是一场比赛
I know it's not a competition,

57
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,300
但我还没在我的传教中给
but I haven't baptized a single investigator

58
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,820
一个调查者施洗
on my mission yet.

59
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,690
没关系 我只转变了
It's okay, I've only converted,

60
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,130
- 大概八九个人 - 八九个
- like, eight or nine people. - Eight or nine?

61
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,180
天啊
Balls.

62
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,360
总之 你觉得我刚才说的怎么样
Anyway, what do you think about what I was saying?

63
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,150
色情片的事
The porno thing?

64
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,670
就像
Like...

65
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,850
上帝是如何向你证明教会是真的
How has God shown you that the church is true?

66
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,890
我不知道 我想我还没有
I don't know. I guess I haven't really...

67
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,370
我还没有想过
I haven't really thought about it.

68
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,290
但你知道它是真的
But you know it's true.

69
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,680
若你们在信心的试炼
If ye receive no witness

70
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,020
之后才得到见证
until after the trial of your faith...

71
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,340
若你们在信心的试炼
If ye receive no witness...

72
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,010
我们还有谁
Who do we have...

73
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,690
在这对夫妇之后
after this couple again?

74
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,210
我想我们还有在好市多遇到的那个秃头男人
I think we have the bald guy we met at Costco.

75
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,130
好的 哦 对

146
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,120
天父可以启示他的福音

教导关于上帝的事 并接受启示
...teach about God and receive revelation,

153
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,970
他们解释上帝的话语 并向世界传讲福音
and they interpret the word of God, and preach

154
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,740
由于叛教

你想进来吗
Would you like to come inside?

156
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,750
人们失去了对福音的认识
...people lose knowledge of the gospel.

157
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,100
你有女性室友吗
Do you have a girl roommate?

除非有另一位女性在场 否则我们不能进去
We can't come inside unless another woman is present

161
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,110
但是  我们可以  待在门口这里

162
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,720
如果你不介意的话
in the doorway, if that's fine with you?

163
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,200
只是为了安全 我们不介意下雨
It's just for safety. We don't mind the rain.

164
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
我妻子在家 这算吗
Well, my wife is home. Does that count?

165
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,760
- 算 - 太好了
- Yeah! - Perfect.

166
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,550
当你说“室友”时 我慌了 我
When you said "roommate," I panicked. I...

167
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,380
自从  之后我就没有室友了
I haven't had a roommate since, uh...

168
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,600
总之 我有一个灵魂伴侣 这就够了
Anyway, I... I have a soulmate and that is good enough?

169
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,080

我妻子在烤派
My wife has pie in the oven.

174
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,130
我在传教期间胖了很多
I've gained so much weight on my mission.

175
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,170
人们总是给我们好吃的
People are always feeding us treats.

我真的很喜欢派 我非常兴奋
I really love pie. I'm super excited.

180
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,410
我奶奶以前做的派最好吃
My grandma used to make the best pie.

181
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,140
好吧 那你和我妻子会相处得很好
Okay, well, you and my wife are gonna get on very well.

182
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,710
- 太好了 - 哦 有一件事
- Great. - Oh, one thing,

183
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,170
墙壁和天花板里有金属
the walls and ceilings have metal in them.

184
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,630
- 我希望这没关系 - 我们不介意
- I hope that's okay. - We don't mind.

185
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,980

200
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,310
听到这个消息很振奋
that refreshing to hear.

201
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,050
有时候 感觉好像
Well, sometimes, it feels like

202
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,360
宗教不再是文化的中心了
maybe religion isn't at the center of culture anymore.

203
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,880
它正在消退 不是吗
Well, it's fading, isn't it?

204
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,400
是的 随着时间的推移 嗯哼
Yeah, over time. Mm-hmm.

205
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,720
好的 你们准备好听听
Okay, are you ready to hear about

206
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,150

207
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,980

I am! Wait.

208
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,630

八个女儿中的一个 我知道

211
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,230
这听起来很糟糕
it's as bad as it sounds.

00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,030
巴恩斯姐妹来自盐湖城
And Sister Barnes is from Salt Lake City.

Born and raised.

217
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,390
我母亲是皈依者 所以
My mother was a convert, so, um,

218
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,910
当我父亲去世后
when my dad passed away,

219
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,040
我们试了几个不同的教会
we auditioned a few different churches,

220
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,520
只是想看看外面有什么
just to see what was out there

221
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,830
看看我们是否还相信它
and see if we still believed in it.

222
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,130
我懂那种感觉
I know that feeling.

223
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,430
我非常懂那种感觉
I know that feeling very well.

224
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,330
找到你真正相信的教义的信仰
It's so important to find your faith

225
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,220
这非常重要
in a doctrine you actually believe,

226
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,060
这是一个非常非常个人的挣扎
and that's a very, very personal struggle.

227
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,100
这是一个我挣扎了
That is a personal challenge that I have struggled with

228
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,580
很长很长时间的个人挑战
for a very, very long time.

229
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,450
你知道
You know,

230
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,500
什么是唯一真正的宗教
what is the one, true religion?

231
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,810
这很有趣 霍尔姐妹告诉我们
It's funny, Sister Hall was telling us

232
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,030
我们应该
that we should

233
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,470
优先考虑其他调查者
prioritize other investigators.

234
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,800
- 哦 - 哦 但是 不
- Oh. - Oh, but no! I...

235
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,120
我只是说
I'm just saying

236
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,770
我可以看出你
that I could tell that you

237
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,470
是一个对灵性非常好奇的人
are a very spiritually curious person,

238
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,380
就像约瑟·斯密一样
just like Joseph Smith.

239
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,870
你知道 约瑟调查了许多不同的教派
You know, Joseph investigated many different denominations,

240
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,130
长老会 卫理公会 天主教
Presbyterian, Methodist, Catholicism.

241
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,560
没有一个完全合适
And none of them quite fit,

242
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,310
这就是为什么约瑟创立了我们的教会
which is why Joseph founded our church.

243
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,480
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

244
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,970
据我所知 别打断我
As I understand it, stop me when I go wrong,

245
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:59,020

摩罗乃 他向他展示了在哪里可以找到
Moroni, who showed him where he could locate

248
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,410
他家附近的一些金页片
some golden plates near his home.

249
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,030
他对这些页片的神秘翻译
His mysterious translation of those plates

250
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,730
构成了这本书的基础
form the basis of this.

251
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,290
哇
Wow!

252
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,550

00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,630
不 说真的
No, seriously,

254
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,690
我们应该向你学习 里德先生
we should be more like you, Mr. Reed!

255
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,560
“阅读”先生
Mr. "Read."

256
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,430
派闻起来真香
The pie smells amazing.

257
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,960
既然你一直在学习摩门经
And now that you've been studying The Book of Mormon,

258
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,530
它让你有什么感觉
how does it make you feel?

259
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,180
你能猜到她在做什么派吗
Can you guess what kind of pie she's making?

260

那是一种恶性疾病
That is a malicious affliction.

279
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,610
我以为你在开玩笑
I... I thought you were making a joke

280
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,530
关于派的玩笑 对不起

你父亲去世后 你有没有看到过他的迹象

没有

当我死后 我想变成一只蝴蝶

只是为了跟随我爱的人

不是他们的胳膊 不是他们的 头
Not their arm, not their... their head,

I'm sorry, I should have offered you water.

310
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,880
智慧语禁止
The word of wisdom forbids

311
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,660
咖啡因和酒精 不是吗
caffeine and alcohol, doesn't it?

312
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,140
它没有  特别提到苏打水
Well, it doesn't, uh, specifically mention soda.

313
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,270
当然 避免含咖啡因的饮料可能更健康
Sure, it may be healthier to avoid caffeinated drinks,

314
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,620
但我们只是不渴
but we're just not thirsty.

315
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,660
啊哈
Aha.

316
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,110
你对尴尬的问题有什么看法
How do you feel about awkward questions?

317
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,280
那个表情包
The meme?

318
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,720
呵呵 不 我想问一个尴尬的
Heh, no. I want to ask an awkward, uh,

319
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,810
一个令人讨厌的问题
an icky question,

320
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,640
一个不敏感的问题 我认为
an insensitive question that I think

321
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,900
这会很快增加我们谈话的深度
will add depth to our conversation

322
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,160
在太阳落山之前
very quickly before the sun goes down

323
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,650
我们今晚就结束了
and we're done for the evening.

324
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,610
但前提是你觉得舒服
But only if you're comfortable with that.

325
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,430
我们不知道自己是否舒服
Well, we won't know if we're comfortable

326
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,040
- 直到你问 所以 - 有道理
- until you ask, so... - Fair point.

327
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,390
也许你直接问
Maybe you just ask?

328
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,890
好的
Okay.

329
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,390
如果你不问
If you don't ask,

330
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,610
我会离开这里 想知道我们错过了什么
I'm gonna leave here wondering what we missed out on.

331
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,750
很好 我的问题是
Very well. My question is this. Um...

332
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,660
现在我觉得它已经被渲染了
Now I feel it's been built up to. Uh...

333
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,890
我应该要求击鼓吗
Should I request a drum roll?

334
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,240
我要请求击鼓
I'm going to request a drum roll.

335
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,150
请击鼓 女士们
A drum roll please, ladies!

336
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,800
继续
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

337
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,620
更多
More! More! More!

338
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,750
现在 我的问题是
Now, I... I... I... my question is,

339
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,080
你对一夫多妻制有什么看法
how do you feel about polygamy?

340
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,690
你对一个男人有多个妻子
How do you... how do you feel about the concept of

341
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,430
的概念有什么看法
a man having multiple wives?

342
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,570
我的意思是 这不适合我
I mean, it's... it's not for me, um...

343
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,920
你是从圣经的角度问的吗
Are you asking from a biblical perspective?

344
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,490
摩门教有一段有争议的历史
Uh, Mormonism has a controversial history

345
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,990
与厌女行为有关
with the misogynist practice

346
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,490
男人拥有多个妻子
of men claiming multiple wives.

347
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,060
但我对现代启示的概念很着迷
But I am fascinated by the idea of Modern Revelation,

348
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,100
它被用来抹去这种行为
which was used to erase this behavior

349
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,620
从 1890 年的教会中
from the church in 1890.

350
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,590
我认为这值得讨论
I just think that's worthy of conversation.

351
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,580
是吗
Yeah? Uh...

352
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,980
我的意思是
And what I mean by that

353
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,760
我们正在讨论一个教会
is that we're discussing a church that

354
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,540
它认为有争议的做法
decided that a controversial practice

355
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,620
是其声誉上的污点 并且实际上阻碍了
was a stain on its reputation, and an actual hindrance

356
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,690
招募新成员 所以它使用了启示
to recruiting new members, and so it used revelation,

357
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,590
上帝对先知说的话
word of God told unto the prophet

358
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,950
来驱逐一个挑衅性的宗教支柱
to banish a provocative religious pillar

359
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,300
这在当代似乎令人反感
that seemed unsavory in contemporary times.

360
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,910
是的 我知道
Yeah, I know that, um,

361
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,980
这可能很难理解
it may be difficult to understand, um,

362
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,050
但是  一夫多妻制是一项精神使命
but, uh, polygamy was a spiritual mission

363
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,050
在当时是必要的
needed at the time in order

364
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,570
为了在经历了很多苦难和流血之后
to grow the ranks of our membership

365
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,140
增加我们的成员人数
in the wake of much hardship and bloodshed.

366
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,920
一个男人有多个妻子
Um... a man having plural wives

367
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:02,670
意味着更多 更多的婴儿来帮助社区发展
meant more... more babies to help the community grow.

368
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,370
嗯
Hmm.

369
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,550
是的 这对我们现代人的大脑来说
It's, yeah, it's sketch for sure,

370
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,160
- 肯定是粗略的 - 它被
- to our modern brains. - And it was...

371
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,770
从教会中移除 不仅仅是因为
it was removed from the church not just because

372
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,420
它很奇怪或有争议
it was grotesque or controversial,

373
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,210
只是因为它不再需要了
but just because it wasn't necessary anymore.

374
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,780
你看 我担心 并且
You see, I worry, and...

375
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,950
原谅我说话大声
forgive my loud language,

376
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,730
呃
uh,

377
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,090
我担心约瑟·斯密利用一夫多妻制的概念
I worry that Joseph Smith used the concept of polygamy

378
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,700
来使他与其他女人的婚外情合法化
to legitimize his affairs with other women.

379
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,810
我担心约瑟的妻子艾玛·斯密
I worry that Joseph's wife, Emma Smith,

380
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,010
当他和范妮·阿尔杰睡觉时 她很生气
was upset when he slept with Fanny Alger,

381
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,710
他们 16 岁的女仆
their sixteen-year-old maid.

382
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,580
我担心他制定了一个计划
I worry that he formulated a plan

383
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,670
在那次轻率行为之后
to use revelation for consequence-free sex

384
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,670
利用启示来进行无后果的性行为
in the aftermath of that indiscretion

385
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,980
以及其他类似的
and others like it.

386
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,290
你知道 “能力越大 责任越大”
You know, "With great power comes great responsibility."

387
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,330
蜘蛛侠
Spiderman.

388
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,510
伏尔泰
Voltaire.

389
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,030
对
Right.

390
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,950
我想向大家提出的是我的担忧
I guess what I would pose to the room is my concern

391
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,260
一夫多妻制没有任何精神意义
that polygamy has no spiritual bearing whatsoever.

392
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,780
我认为这有点扭曲
That is somewhat of a distortion, I think...

393
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,150
教会自己的历史证实
The church's own history corroborates

394
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,520
并暗示了这种
and implies this...

395
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,000
愤世嫉俗的洗脑策略
...cynical brainwashing tactic.

396
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,180
这是真的吗
Is that true?

397
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,790
我 对不起
I... I... I'm sorry,

398
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,680
我不知道你从哪里得到这些
I... I'm not sure where you're getting this.

399
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,890
如果上帝的启示是通过人过滤的
If revelation by God is filtered through man

400
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,100
而人是有缺陷的 人会犯罪 人会撒谎
and man is flawed and man sins and man lies,

401
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,280
那我们怎么知道这一切都是真的
then how do we know any of it's true?

402
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,760
我们知道这是真的 因为它给我们的感觉
We know it's true because of how it makes us feel.

403
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,980
宾果 说得对
Bingo! That's exactly right!

404
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,200
完全正确 完全同意
That's exactly right. Couldn't agree more.

405
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,860
重要的是我们与上帝的个人关系
It's our personal relationship with God which matters.

406
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,680
让我们和我们的主教谈谈
Let us talk with our bishop

407
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,260
你提出的一些观点
about some of the points you're raising. Um...

408
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,120
问题 你最喜欢的快餐是什么
Question. What's your favorite fast food?

409
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,520
我尽量不吃
I try not to eat it.

410
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,310
我们都不吃 但是 说吧 我们都有一个
None of us do, but go on, we've all got one.

411
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,870
嗯
Um...

412
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,440
好的 汉堡王比卡乐星好
Okay. Burger King is better than Carl's Junior...

413
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,790
什么是卡乐星
What's Carl's Junior?

414
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,360
东海岸的哈迪斯
Hardee's on the East Coast.

415
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,790
汉堡王比哈迪斯好
Burger King is better than Hardee's

416
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,230
哈迪斯比拉力好
which is better than Rally's...

417
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,750
- 拉力 - 切克斯
- Rally's? - Checkers.

418
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,510
汉堡王比
Burger King is better

419
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,270
哈迪斯好 哈迪斯比切克斯好
than Hardee's, which is better than Checkers,

420
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,450
切克斯比温蒂好 温蒂比 In-N-Out 好
which is better than Wendy's, which is better than In-N-Out,

421
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,800
In-N-Out 比麦当劳好
which is better than McDonalds,

422
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,930
麦当劳比盒子里的杰克好
which is better than Jack in the Box,

423
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,450
盒子里的杰克比什么都没有好
which is better than nothing.

424
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,650
盒子里的杰克全天供应早餐
Jack in the Box serves breakfast all day.

425
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,850
我喜欢早餐
I love breakfast!

426
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,980
塔可钟呢
What about Taco Bell?

427
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,370
我们不谈论塔可钟
We don't talk about Taco Bell.

428
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,980
为什么我们不谈论塔可钟
Why don't we talk about Taco Bell?

429
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,940
我们必须谈论塔可钟才能谈论
We'd have to talk about Taco Bell to talk about...

430
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,270
为什么我们不谈论塔可钟
why we don't talk about Taco Bell.

431
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,600
好吧 所以汉堡王是第一名
All right, so... so Burger King is number one.

432
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,170
- 我觉得它是垃圾 - 哦
- I think it's trash. - Oh.

433
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,990
对 不是盒子里的杰克
Right. Not Jack in the Box.

434
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,120
我投温蒂
I vote Wendy's.

435
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,250
我可以支持
I could support.

436
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,350
好的 温蒂就是它了 是的
Good! Wendy's it is. Yeah.

437
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,740
你知道吗 我从来没有吃过温蒂
Do you know? I've never had a Wendy.

438
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,910
我说错了
That came out wrong.

439
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,780
没关系
It's okay.

440
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,660
所以当我开始学习神学时
So when I started studying theology,

441
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,700
我最不想做的就是找到
the last thing I wanted to do was find...

442
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,320
宗教中的温蒂
the Wendy's of religions.

443
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,710
我只是在写一篇
I was just writing a research paper

444
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,060
大学课程的研究论文 我满足于涉猎
for a college class, and I was content with dabbling.

445
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,280
所以 这里吃点麦乐鸡 那里吃个汉堡王皇堡
So, some McNuggets here, BK Whopper over there,

446
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,890
随便什么心情
whatever fit the mood.

447
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:07,810
当我研究这些流派 麦当劳 汉堡王 In-N-Out
As I studied the genres, McD, BK, In-N-Out,

448
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:11,730
即 摩门教 山达基教 伊斯兰教 佛教
i.e., Mormonism, Scientology, Islam, Buddhism,

449
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,170
当我通过流派和
as I got closer to God

450
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,560
严格的研究更接近上帝时
through genre and rigorous study,

451
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,690
当我致力于我与天父的个人关系时
as I worked on my personal relationship

452
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,610
我想我加强了它
with Heavenly Father, and I think strengthened it,

453
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,310
你知道我发现了什么吗
do you know what I found?

454
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,400
你知道的越多 你知道的就越少
The more you know, the less you know.

455
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,660
当我 50 岁的时候 我营养不良
And by the time I was 50, I was malnourished

456
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,010
因为我一直在吃宗教快餐
from the fast food of religion I'd been packing into my brain

457
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,540
在过去十年的大部分时间里
for the best part of a decade.

458
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,480
每个教派 邪教 信条 教派
Every sect, cult, creed, denomination

459
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,420
都声称自己是唯一真正的教义
all claimed to be the one, true doctrine,

460
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,730
但在显微镜下观察时 似乎没有一个是真的
and yet none seemed true when held under the microscope.

461
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,650
所以我想知道还有什么
So I wondered what else was out there.

462
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,470
我向你保证
I promise you,

463
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,840
我最不想做的
the last thing I wanted to do

464
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,210
就是找到唯一真正的宗教
was find the one true religion.

465
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,040
但不幸的是 我找到了
But unfortunately, I did.

Yeah, I don't want to spook him,

474
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,800

让我们礼貌地结束这个 然后回去
let's just politely wrap this and head back.

479
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,200
只是重点
Just the highlights...

They're locked outside.

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,790
他拿着我们的外套
He has our coats.

自行车锁的钥匙在我外套口袋里
The key to the bike lock is in my coat pocket.

所以我们需要我们的外套
So we need our coats.

Yeah.

503
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,340
- 我们需要 - 我不知道 我们需要吗

504
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,100
不穿外套 不骑自行车走回去
Walk back without coats and bikes?

505
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,460
那有多远 两英里
What is that, two miles?

506
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,240
不 我觉得是四英里
No, I think it's four.

507
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,870
这有点过分 但是 我
It's a little over the top, but I...

508
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,500
我没事 我可以走 是吗
I'm fine. I'm fine to walk, yeah?

509
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,860
- 卡住了 - 解锁
- It's stuck. - Unlock it.

510
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,170
没有 锁
There's no... lock.

511

512
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,390
这里
Here. Here.

513

他还在吗
Is he still there?

515
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,850
我们不是听到他走了吗
Didn't we hear him leave?

516
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,070
你确定吗
Are you sure?

517
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,250
我们应该向他求助吗
Should we ask him for help?

518
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,470
不
No.

519
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,210
你能从这里钻过去吗
Can you fit through this?

520
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,730
你疯了吗
You crazy?

521
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,050
我们应该试试霍尔姐妹 好吗
Um, we should try Sister Hall, okay?

522
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,260
或者肯尼迪长老 只是让他们知道我们在哪里
Or Elder Kennedy, just so they know where we are.

523
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,590
没有回应
It's not going through.

524
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,020
是暴风雨 继续尝试 好吗
It's the storm. Keep trying, okay?

525
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,570
好的
Okay.

526
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,050
我们寻求帮助
We ask for help, hmm?

527
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,340
会没事的
It'll be fine.

528
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,020
里德先生
Mr. Reed?

529
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,040
他们来了 欢迎
And there they are! Welcome.

530
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:24,570
里德先生 你太慷慨了
Mr. Reed, you have been too generous with your time.

531
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,350
帕克斯顿姐妹和我刚才还在说
Sister Paxton and I were just saying

532
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,050
这是一件多么愉快的事
what a pleasure it's been.

533
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,570
但是我们刚和霍尔姐妹通完电话
Um, but we just got off the phone with Sister Hall,

534
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,050
她需要我们回到教会
and she needs us to return to the church.

535
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,140
- 哦 好吧 - 不幸的是 是的
- Oh! Oh, well... - Unfortunately, yeah.

536
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,270
如果你想离开 我不会留你
I won't keep you if you wish to leave.

537
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:41,200
我们被召回了
We've been summoned back.

538
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,810
是的
Yeah.

539

该死的 因为我们才
Damn it! Damn it, 'cause we were just

00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,680
刚刚开始 不是吗
getting started, weren't we?

541
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,510
你知道 你让我觉得也许你
You know, you had me thinking that maybe you were

542
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,330
的拜访有什么意义
onto something with your visit.

543
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,160
我印象深刻 但我理解
I've been impressed, but I understand.

544
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,530
是的 你的外套在这里
Uh, yeah, your coats are here,

545
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,900
挂在长椅后面
hanging on the back of the pew.

546
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,260
请稍等一下
Excuse me one moment.

547
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,290

开门
with the door. Um...

551
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,920
它有点棘手
It's... it's a little tricky.

552
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,620
对不起
I'm sorry?

553
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,620
我想你的门在那里有点卡住了
I think your door is a bit stuck out there.

554
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,410
门打不开
The door won't open.

555
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,970
前门
The front door.

556
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,540
是的 前门又打不开了
Yeah, the front door won't open again.

557
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,320
我们进来的时候它打开了
It opened when we came in.

558
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,100
是的
Yeah.

559
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,070
也许如果你解锁 它就会打开
Maybe if you unlock it, it will open?

560
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,120
不 我明白你在问我什么
No, no, I... I... I understand what you're asking me,

561
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,290
但是
but, uh,

562
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,420
门闩是定时的
the deadbolts are on a timer.

563
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,550
我和你们的谈话太投入了
I got carried away with our conversation,

564
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,680
我没有意识到支架已经设置好了
I didn't realize the brace had been set.

565
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,740
你们进来的时候我应该拔掉销子的
I should have pulled the pin when you came in,

566
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,300
但我忘了 所以如果你现在
but I forgot. So if you are now

567
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,340
遗憾地准备离开
regrettably ready to leave,

568
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,270
你必须从我家后面出去
you'll have to exit through the back of my house.

569
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,880
哪里
Uh, where?

570
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,180
就在这里
Just through here.

571
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:43,190
好吧 你能把前面的那个解锁吗 拜托
Well, can you just unlock the front one, please?

572
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,310
我们想走那边
We would like to go that way.

573
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,540
这样我们出去的时候
Just so we don't get turned around

574
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,760
就不会迷路
and confused when we get outside.

575
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,890
是的 它要到早上才会再打开
Yeah, it won't open again 'til morning.

576
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,460
拜托 先生
Please, sir?

577
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,030
哦 对不起
Oh, I'm sorry.

578
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,420
我向你保证 这样离开是安全的
I promise you, it's safe to leave this way.

579
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,640
嗯
Huh?

580
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,470
有一扇门
It's a little unusual to have a door

581
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,730
定时上锁 这有点不寻常
that, um, locks on a timer?

582
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,870
呃
Uh...

583
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,960
是的 我知道
Yes, well, I see that.

584
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,920
是的
Yeah.

585
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,700
而且它
And it's...

586
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,180
好吧 它不能解锁 这有点不寻常
Well, it's a little unusual that it can't be unlocked.

587
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,880
不 我知道
No, I... I... I know.

588
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,490
我有足够的自知之明 知道这可能是什么样子
I am self-aware enough to know how this might look.

589
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,210
一个老人 两个年轻女子在他家里
Older man, two young women in his house,

590
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:34,930
但我向你保证 你可以随意离开
but I assure you, you are welcome to leave

591
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,280
从后面
through... through the back.

592
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,720
你从外面看到我的房子了 对吧
You saw my house from the outside, right?

593
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,070
- 嗯哼 - 对
- Mm-hmm. - Right!

594
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,370
所以 你知道它占地面积很小
So, you know it's a tiny footprint.

595
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,680
房子的后面就在那里
The back of the house is just there.

596
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,850
是的
Yeah.

597
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,460
总之 我会给你空间让你自由地做出决定
Anyway, I will leave you space to make your decision freely.

598
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,600
是的
Yeah.

599
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,300
澄清一下 我正在努力
To clarify, I am trying...

600
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,840
一直努力做到
have been trying very hard to make it a point

601
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,260
不给你施加压力
not to pressure you,

602
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,920
所以你甚至不应该觉得有必要
so you shouldn't even feel the need

603
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,790
编造一个关于你病房里的人的故事
to fabricate a story about someone from your ward

604
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,660
打电话让你离开 这 完全没问题
calling you to leave. It's... perfectly fine.

605
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,840
你想什么时候离开就什么时候离开
Leave when you want.

606
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,990
这不是借口 他们确实需要我们回去
It wasn't an excuse, they do need us back.

607
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,630
不 我知道 但你说你接了一个电话
No, I know, but you're saying you took a call

608
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,720
和你病房里的人打的电话
with someone from your ward.

609
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,160
是的 刚才
Yeah, a moment ago.

610
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,460
但是当你进来的时候 我问你是否可以接受
But when you came inside, I asked if you were okay

611
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,370
墙壁和天花板上的金属
with the metal in the walls and ceilings.

612
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,640
你是什么意思
What do you mean?

613
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,810
我的意思是金属会阻碍手机信号
I mean that the metal obstructs cell phone signals,

614
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,170
所以我知道你没有接电话 但是
so I do know you didn't take a call. But...

615
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,300
只是为了清楚起见
Just to be clear,

616
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,080
所以你很舒服
so you're comfortable,

617
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,130
你完全可以自行离开
it is totally fine for you to leave on your own accord.

618
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:46,090
你永远不需要觉得你必须
You never need to feel like you have to...

619
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,740
找借口 或者告诉我一些
...make excuses or... or tell me little...

620
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,440
一些 小谎言
little... little white lies.

621
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,800
所以哪扇门通向外面
So which door takes us outside?

622
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,410
噗
Pff.

623
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,410
好吧 你有偏好吗
Well... do you have a preference?

624
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,220
什 为什么我会有偏好
Wh... why would I have a preference?

625
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,030
我们应该有偏好吗
Should we have a preference?

626
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,640
这是一个公平的问题
That is a fair question.

627
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,820
不是完全奇怪 但是你的妻子能不能
Not to be completely weird, but can your wife

628
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,600
请走进房间
please just step in the room,

629
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,780
打个招呼 然后带我们去房子的后面
say hello and walk us to the back of the house?

630
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,450
我不是想装傻
I'm not trying to be silly,

631
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,120
我保证 我真的不是
I promise, I'm really not,

632
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,700
但是我们遵循规则 我们对它们很坦诚
but there are rules we follow, and we were upfront with them.

633
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,350
我会问的
I will ask.

634
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,170
我可以先问你一个问题吗
Can I ask you a question first?

635
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,020
你
Do you...

636
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,860
你还相信我的妻子在隔壁房间吗
still believe that my wife is in the next room?

637
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,860
尽管有相反的证据
Despite all the evidence to the contrary,

638
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,510
香薰蜡烛
the scented candle,

639
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,510
没有烤箱和蓝莓派
the absence of an oven with blueberry pie?

640
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,120
或者你一直在礼貌地纵容一个谎言
Or have you been politely indulging a lie?

641
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,350
如果你仍然相信她在那里 我会去问
If you still believe that she's in there, I'll go ask,

642
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,570
但这是我想让你思考的事情
but it's something I want you to think about

643
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,920
也许思考一下
and maybe think about

644
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,300
在你的信仰背景下
in the context of your beliefs.

645
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,570
你相信上帝是因为
Do you believe in God because

646
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,250
有人在你易受影响的年龄告诉你
somebody told you at an impressionable age

647
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,930
上帝是真实的 尽管你长大后
that God is real, despite having doubts

648
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,410
有疑问 尽管
as you got older, despite...

649
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,540
一生中都看到了相反的证据
seeing evidence to the contrary your whole lives?

650
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,370
当你父亲失去对身体的控制时
When your father lost control of his body,

651
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,330
你认为这是上帝的计划要毁了他的生活吗
did you think it was God's plan to ruin his life?

652
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,630
或者你继续相信一些东西
Or did you go on believing something

653
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:37,420
你知道那不是真的 只是为了给你安慰
that you know is not true just to give you comfort

654
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,070
因为你害怕如果这一切都是谎言
because you were afraid of what it might mean

655
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,070
那意味着什么
if it was all a lie?

656
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,390
我把香薰蜡烛放在桌子上
I put the scented candle on the table

657
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,380
因为我想让你思考
because I wanted you to think

658
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,030
你相信的事情
about the things that you believe

659
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,910
只是因为有人让你相信它们
just because somebody asked you to believe them.

660
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,700
可以
Can...

661
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,620
我们可以用你的电话吗
Can we use your phone?

662
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,310
拜托
Please?

663
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,400
我没有电话
I... I don't have a telephone.

664
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,680
你有一个非常漂亮的家 里德先生
You have a really beautiful home, Mr. Reed.

665
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,380
这里就像一座教堂
It's like a church in here.

666
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,070
你自己建造的吗
Did you build it yourself?

667
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,290
我妻子建造的
My wife built it.

668
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,690
我们要离开
We're gonna leave

669
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,350
从你家后面
through the back of your house.

670
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,440
现在 可以吗
Now, is that okay?

671
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,530
当然
Of course.

672
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,880
就像你说的 没关系
Just like you said, it's okay,

673
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,900
我们可以离开 对吧
and we can leave, right?

674
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,920
没错
That's right.

675
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,160
什么事
What is it?

676
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
巴恩斯姐妹
Sister Barnes?

677
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,360
那是地下室
That's a basement.

678
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,380
看起来这不通向外面
It doesn't look like this goes outside.

679
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,560
我想你可以看出我们对今晚的情况
I think that you can tell that we're regrettably

680
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:49,170
感到遗憾地不舒服
uncomfortable with this situation here tonight.

681
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,530
对不起 但你刚才不是说
I'm sorry, but didn't you just say a moment ago

682
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,530
你看到我房子的外面了吗
that you saw the outside of my house?

683
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,360
所以你清楚地看到了
So then you clearly saw...

684
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,540
我房子的后面悬在一座小山上
...that the back of my house overhangs a hill,

685
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,010
所以你会知道你必须下去
so you would know that you have to go down...

686
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,590
才能出去
...in order to go out.

687
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,280
我认为对你来说最好
I think it would be best for you

688
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,410
对我们所有人来说 如果你能帮助我们
and for all of us if you could help us

689
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,030
回家 因为

还有目击者 不是吗 巴恩斯姐妹
And there were witnesses, weren't there, Sister Barnes?

694
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,040
在来这里的路上 我们经过了一名警官
On our way here, we passed a police officer?

695

哇 警察 我向你保证
Whoa! The police? I promise you,

696
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:33,610

对
Right.

698
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:37,140
但我认为我们害怕
But I think that we're scared

699
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,190
因为你早些时候对我们撒谎了
because you lied to us earlier.

700
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,830
你想让我帮忙吗
Do you want me to help?

701

你早些时候问我是否应该
You asked me earlier if you should

非常仔细地

705
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,580
然后做出正确的决定
and then make the right decision.

706
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,770

然后做出一个真诚的决定

723

724

实际上完成了它

00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,740
也许这让你想起了

726
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,400
别的东西

727
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,070
只是一个想法

现在 接下来的部分非常重要

你玩过 1904 年的棋盘游戏吗

因为落在别人的财产上

742
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,690
以及形成垄断的最终目标

迫使你的对手退出游戏

游戏和我们离开有什么关系

在世界历史上 而可怜的老伊丽莎白·玛吉

我们相信天父 是的

我知道这些是你现在正在思考的事情

《我呼吸的空气》的旋律和节奏

所以也许你认识拉娜·德雷

817
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,380
她非常了不起地被电台司令乐队起诉

00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,950
因为她在 2017 年的歌曲中剽窃了《爬行》

819
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:56,210

稀释信息
Diluting the message.

823
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:06,000
掩盖原作
Obscuring the original.

824
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:13,190
犹太教是原始的一神论宗教
Judaism is the OG monotheistic religion.

825
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,750
按理说 它应该
It should, by a wide margin,

826
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:18,950
拥有最多的实践成员 然而

827
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:22,150
它只占世界人口的 0.2%
it makes up only 0.2% of the world's population.

828
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,540
为什么会这样
Why is that?

829
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:25,760
为什么原作不如

830
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,200
迭代受欢迎
than the iteration?

831
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,510
它是否比其他宗教更不真实

832
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:35,250
我们是在谈论宗教 棋盘游戏还是音乐

是的
Yes.

834
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,780
它的成员最少 因为它不做广告
It has the fewest members because it doesn't advertise.

835
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,020
它没有像你这样的人

836
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,350
敲门
knocking on doors,

向人们推销更好的生活

更好的棋盘游戏 更好的歌曲

839
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,400
你有没有想过
You ever think about that?

840
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:53,270
传教士实际上只是一个组织的
How missionaries are really just salespeople

841
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:54,660
销售人员
for an organization?

842

你销售的产品是一个想法

我今晚想对你说的是
And what I'm trying to say to you tonight

849
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:17,250
我有一个想法 我想卖给你

850
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,630
我的论点是 神圣的文本
My argument is that the holy texts

851
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,240
我们所崇敬的
which we revere

852
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,160
只是古代人一直在

853

它们在任何字面意义上都不是真实的或真实的
They're not true or real in any literal sense.

如果上帝是真的 他会在我们自慰时看着我们

漂浮在太空中的一块岩石上

如果我告诉你这是戈登·辛克利
Would it help if I told you this is Gordon B. Hinckley,

to go through based on your faith.

923
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,200
是
Are...

924
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,510
你是要我们
are you asking us

925
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,550
审议我们对教会的信仰吗
for us to deliberate our belief in the church?

926
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:42,030
这是一个与我们回家
Is that a factor which will correspond

927
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,550
相对应的因素吗
to us going home?

928
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:48,830
我要求你在信仰和不信仰之间做出选择
I'm asking you to choose between belief, and disbelief.

929
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:53,480
我自己的主张是 世界上现存的 10000 种
My own claim is that all 10,000 verifiable religions

930
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,310
可验证的宗教
that exist in the world today

931
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:57,620
都和你们现在所处的
are as artificial as the symbolic church

932
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,100
象征性教堂一样虚假
you are currently standing in.

933
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,400
这是一场闹剧
It is farce.

934
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,010
这里没有神圣的东西
There is nothing holy here.

935
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:06,140
你们的宗教文本只是装饰品
Your religious text is mere ornament...

936
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,810
空洞而资本主义
...as hollow and as capitalistic

937
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,890
就像这些荒谬的游戏一样
as these ridiculous games.

938
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:45,180
我想知道我们会发生什么
I want to know what is going to happen to us

939
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,940
- 在我们选择之前 - 我甚至不知道
- before we choose. - I don't even know

940
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:48,710
如果还没有发生
how to begin to answer that question

941
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,230
我该如何回答这个问题
if it hasn't happened yet.

942
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:52,580
哇 里德先生
Wow, Mr. Reed,

943
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:57,110
你提出了很多有趣的观点
you've introduced a lot of interesting points.

944
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:01,030
我想我们可以承认你是一个非常聪明的人
I think we can admit that you're a very smart man

945
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:03,470
我们还有很多东西要学
and we still have a lot to learn.

946
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,900
因此 我想同意
So with that, I would like to agree

947
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,070
你已经
that you've...

948
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,470
说服了我们
convinced us,

949
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:10,910
我们想离开
and we'd like to leave

950
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:13,160
穿过不信仰之门 现在就回家
through the disbelief door and go home now.

951
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,690
对吧 巴恩斯姐妹
Right, Sister Barnes?

952
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,180
姐妹
Sister?

953
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,000
巴恩斯姐妹
Sister Barnes?

954
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,010
我想我们应该听听我们超级整洁
I think we should listen to our super neat

955
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:32,880
和体贴的主人的话 选择正确的门
and thoughtful host and choose the right door?

956
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:35,040
你知道 选择“正确的”
You know, choose the "right"?

957
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,670
就像他们在初级会教我们的那样
Like they taught us in primary?

958
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:38,150
这不
It doesn't...

959
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:40,370
不管你对他说什么
matter what you say to him.

960
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:42,900
他不会让我们走
He's not gonna let us go

961
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:44,980
只是因为我们承认他是对的
just because we admit he's right.

962
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:47,720
让我们趁我们的主人好心让
Let's just get out of here while our host is being

963
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,770
我们离开的时候离开这里
gracious enough to let us leave.

964
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:52,810
我认为我们正在被研究
I think that we're being studied.

965
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,730
我认为他想根据我们打开哪扇门
I think he wants to learn something about us

966
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:59,170
来了解我们的一些情况
based on which door we open.

967
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,180
这就是游戏吗
Is that the game?

968
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:09,230
有人挠了挠脖子 他在看
Someone scratches their neck, and he's watching.

969
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:12,530
我们说错了话 他结结巴巴地说不出话来
We say the wrong thing, and he stumbles on his words.

970
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:15,840
烛焰闪烁 捕捉了他的注意力
A candle flame flickers, and it captures his attention.

971
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:18,670
你一直在寻找什么
What have you been looking for?

972
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:22,110
你发现了什么
What have you found?

973
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,840
如果我是对的
If I'm right,

974
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:27,200
那么现在唯一重要的是
then the only thing that matters right now

975
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,850
我们真正相信什么
is what we actually believe.

976
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,640
因为我认为你的言辞很单薄
And because I think your rhetoric is thin,

977
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:38,070
你把旧货市场的棋盘游戏比作
and your garage sale board game metaphor

978
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,690
有点冒犯
is kind of offensive.

979
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,910
我的意思是 你问为什么犹太教只占
I mean, you asked why Judaism only makes up

980
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:44,950
世界人口的 0.2%
0.2% of the world's population

981
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,010
但甚至没有停下来谈论大屠杀
but didn't even pause for the Holocaust.

982
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,180
你没有承认犹太人面临的
You make no acknowledgement of the religious persecution

983
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,460
宗教迫害
Jewish people have faced.

984
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,740
你只是把它当作一个
You just use it as a setup

985
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,530
关于传教士的笑话的铺垫
to a punchline about missionaries.

986
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:56,490
然后 你跳过了这样一个事实
And then, you skip over the fact

987
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:58,010
所有这些都没有提到伊斯兰教
that none of this addresses Islam,

988
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:00,530
因为穆斯林甚至不相信基督复活了
as Muslims don't even believe Christ was resurrected.

989
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,350
然后 你指出了所有这些神话中的神
And then, you point out all the similarities

990
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,150
与耶稣的相似之处
these mythological gods have with Jesus,

991
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:07,220
但忽略了许多明显的差异
but breeze over the many glaring differences!

992
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,290
其中一个家伙有一个该死的鸟头
One of these guys has a freaking bird head!

993
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:15,730
我不认为 我的观点
I don't think... that my point of view...

994
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:19,380
符合信仰或不信仰
fits into belief or disbelief.

995
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,470
我认为有一个完整的频谱
I think there's an entire spectrum

996
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:23,250
你的游戏忽略了
that your game is neglecting.

997
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:27,890
所以这与我信不信无关 对吗
So it doesn't matter what I believe, does it?

998
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:34,570
帕克斯顿姐妹 你还相信上帝吗
Sister Paxton, do you still believe in God?

999
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:36,750
是的
Yes.

1000
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:39,920
那我们从这里离开
Then let's leave through here.

1001
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:43,660
让我们诚实和真诚
Let's be honest and sincere

1002
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:46,200
让上帝决定我们接下来会发生什么
and let God decide what happens next for us.

1003
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:02,120
好的 我们现在要离开了
Okay, we're leaving now.

1004
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:04,910
感谢你所有的指导
Thank you for all your mentorship,

1005
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:06,870
感谢你让我们离开
and thank you for letting us leave.

1006
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:37,160
你也要来吗
Are you coming too?

1007
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:49,860
姐妹
Sister...

1008
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:53,910
没关系
It's okay.

1009
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:57,090
一步一步来 我们慢慢走
One step at a time. We'll go slow.

1010
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:00,150
巴恩斯姐妹 什么都没有
Sister Barnes, there's nothing.

1011
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:01,930
都被挡住了
It's all blocked off.

1012
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,370
你觉得他想要什么
What do you think he wants?

1013
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,010
他会把我们永远关在这里吗
Is he gonna keep us here forever?

1014
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:09,080
不 他太聪明了 他
No, he's too smart. He...

1015
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,070
他知道长老会来找我们
He knows an Elder will check on us, and...

1016
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:17,080
这意味着他要么必须让我们走 要么
which means he'll either have to let us go or...

1017
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,170
杀了我们
kill us.

1018
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:27,680
从现在开始 如果他提出了一个
From now on, if he lands a philosophical point

1019
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,490
我们不同意的哲学观点 我们就挑战他
that we don't agree with, we challenge him.

1020
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,310
我们让他思考
We make him think.

1021
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:34,700
他不必压倒我们
He doesn't have to steam roll us.

1022
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:36,490
我们可能不是身体上的威胁
We might not be a physical threat,

1023
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:38,270
但我们可以成为智力上的威胁
but we can be an intellectual one.

1024
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:56,120
我认为那扇窗户上有一个笼子
I think that window has a cage on it.

1025
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,430
你说得对
You're right.

1026
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:04,430
他来了
He's coming. He's coming.

1027
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:09,480
拿着这个
Take this.

1028
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,960
拿着这个 放回去
Take this. Put it back.

1029
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:24,470
如果发生任何事情 你就拿着这个
If anything happens, you take this,

1030
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:26,710
用尽全力
and you stab him in the neck as hard

1031
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,020
尽快地刺他的脖子
and as fast as you can.

1032
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,410
- 不 - 必须是你
- No! No, no! - It has to be you.

1033
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:30,980
他太注意我了
He's watching me too closely.

1034
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,700
- 他不会想到我们会这么做 - 姐妹 不
- He won't expect us to do it. - Sister, no!

1035
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,330
好的 我们定一个暗号
Okay. Let's have a code word.

1036
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:35,720
好吗 嗯
Okay? Um...

1037
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,720
嘿 如果我说“魔法内衣”
Hey, if I say "magic underwear,"

1038
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:39,600
那就意味着刺 好吗
that means stab. Okay?

1039
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,430
他来了
He's coming.

1040
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,990
魔法内衣 这是暗号 好吗
Magic underwear. That's the code word. Okay?

1041
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:18,990
里德先生
Mr. Reed?

1042
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,130
里德夫人
Mrs. Reed?

1043

Is that you?

1044

我必须确定
before I introduced you to her.

1066
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,290
确定什么
Sure about what?

1067
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:59,030
你现在正站在一位
You are now in the presence

活着的上帝先知面前
of a living prophet of God.

1069
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:21,400
我今晚邀请你进入
The reason I invited you

1070
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,270
我的圣殿的原因是
into my sanctuary tonight is because

1071
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:25,140
我看到了一个奇迹
I have been shown a miracle.

1072
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:28,410
我相信这个奇迹证明
I believe this miracle is proof

1073
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:31,850
所有已知的宗教都是明显错误的
that all known religions are demonstrably false,

1074
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:35,290
只是对某种真实事物的古老回声
and only an ancient echo of something true.

1075
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,120
我需要一个见证人
I need a witness,

1076
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:43,290
你 来验证这个奇迹是真的

01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,000
太好了 你听到了什么
Great! What did you hear?

1233
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,050
她说有一个售票员
She said there was a conductor.

1234
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:21,860
- 是的 - 她是指天使吗
- Yes. Yeah. - Did she mean angel?

1235
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:24,540
她有一种分离感
She had a feeling of disassociation,

1236
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:27,230
一种不真实的感觉
a feeling that something wasn't real.

1237
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:28,360
就是这样
That's it.

1238
01:17:29,230 --> 01:17:30,360
所以现在你知道了
So now you know.

1239
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:33,060
现在 我们知道了
Now, we know?

1240
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:34,280
是的 现在 你知道了
Yeah, now, you know.

1241
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:36,540
知道
Know?

1242
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,070
我可以给你看上帝
I can show you God.

1243
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:43,420
如果你愿意去死
If you're willing to die.

1244
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:45,900
它可以是无痛的 它可以是暂时的
It... it can be painless. It can be temporary.

1245
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:48,380
像先知一样 你可以被带回来
Like the Prophet, you can be brought back.

1246
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,340
它不一定是可怕的
It doesn't have to be frightening at all.

1247
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:52,730
我告诉你什么是可怕的
I'll tell you... I'll tell you what's frightening.

1248
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:54,380
不知道才是可怕的
Not knowing is frightening!

1249
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:56,040
我们从哪里来 我们在这里做什么
Where do we come from? What are we doing here?

1250
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,740
我们的目的是什么
What's our purpose?

1251
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:00,220
这些问题的恐惧是宗教存在的原因
The terror of those questions is why religions exist.

1252
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:02,090
我可以为你回答这些问题
I can answer those questions for you.

1253
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:05,090
我可以给你一种世界上任何宗教
I can give you a comfort no religion in the world

1254
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:07,230
都无法给予你的安慰
is capable of giving you.

1255
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,140
现在一切都说得通了
It all makes sense now.

1256
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:15,500
我整晚都在问自己
I've been asking myself all night,

1257
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,150
他怎么会让我们自杀成为我们的主意
how is he gonna make killing us our idea?

1258
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,590
巴恩斯姐妹 你陷入了困境
Sister Barnes, you're in a muddle.

1259
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:24,940
我知道 我不知道
I know. I can't tell

1260
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:26,510
你在下国际象棋还是跳棋
if you're playing chess or checkers.

1261
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,770
大富翁
Monopoly!

1262
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:30,340
拜托 它就在那里
Come on, it was right there.

1263
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:31,910
你没有给我们展示奇迹
You didn't show us a miracle.

1264
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:33,470
好的 我给你展示了什么
Okay, what did I show you?

1265
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:36,130
那不是奇迹
That wasn't a miracle.

1266
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,860
你是这么说的 我给你展示了什么
So you say. What did I show you?

1267
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:39,590
那不是奇迹
That was not a miracle!

1268
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:41,300
我给你展示了什么
What did I show you?

1269
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:45,700
这是一个魔术
It was a magic trick.

1270
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,290
一个魔术
A magic trick?

1271
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:56,530
你想知道为什么我们不谈论塔可钟吗
You wanna know why we don't talk about Taco Bell?

1272
01:18:57,490 --> 01:18:59,270
它在我四岁的时候杀死了我
It killed me when I was four years old.

1273
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,500
五十人因大肠杆菌爆发住院
Fifty people were hospitalized from an E. coli outbreak.

1274
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:04,460
学校的孩子们叫我塔可地狱
The kids at school called me Taco Hell

1275
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:05,890
因为我在临床上已经死了
'cause I was clinically dead

1276
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:08,110
当医生对我的肾脏进行手术时
while doctors operated on my kidneys.

1277
01:19:10,510 --> 01:19:11,730
当我死的时候
When I was dead,

1278
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,250
我看到了你的先知所描述的一切
I saw exactly what your prophet described.

1279
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:18,950
一道耀眼的白光
A blinding white light,

1280
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:22,480
云 但不是天堂 一种想要回归的感觉
clouds, but not Heaven, a sense of wanting to return,

1281
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,960
一种我的现实状态不真实的感觉
a feeling that my state of reality wasn't real.

1282
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:28,700
那不是预言
That wasn't a prophecy.

1283
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:32,350
那是一次濒死体验
That was a near-death experience.

1284
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:34,530
当氧气离开你的大脑时
When the oxygen leaves your brain

1285
01:19:34,530 --> 01:19:36,620
或者你的心脏停止跳动 你的大脑
or your heart stops pumping, your mind

1286
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:38,930
会创造出难以置信的东西
creates unbelievable things.

1287
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:42,540
我认为你一直让这个女人处于死亡的边缘
I think you've been keeping this woman

1288
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:44,720
为了问她一些问题
on the edge of death in order to ask her questions

1289
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:47,110
关于毫无意义的幻觉
about meaningless hallucinations

1290
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:49,940
这样你就可以证实你的想法
so that you can substantiate your idea

1291
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:52,770
什么是唯一真正的宗教
of what the one, true religion really is.

1292
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:55,290
你知道吗
Did you know...

1293
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:57,120
当你记住某件事时
that when you remember something,

1294
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,420
你实际上只记得
you're really only remembering

1295
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:00,180
你最后一次记住那次经历
the last time you remembered that experience?

1296
01:20:01,770 --> 01:20:03,420
你实际上并没有回忆起那件事
You're not actually recalling the event.

1297
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:07,390
所以你对在塔可钟死去的记忆
So your memory of dying at Taco Bell...

1298
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:08,740
并不是真正的死亡
...isn't really of dying,

1299
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:10,440
它是记忆的记忆
it's of the memory of the memory

1300
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,090
的记忆的记忆的记忆
of the memory of the memory of the memory...

1301
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:14,660
阻止我 的那件事
stop me... ...of that event.

1302
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,370
所以你记住了一个错误的关联
So you're remembering a false correlation

1303
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:19,960
与你刚刚目睹的经历
with the experience you've just witnessed.

1304
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:22,540
但这是 这是正在发生的事情
But this, this is happening right now!

1305
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:26,620
这就是为什么我认为 巴恩斯姐妹 帕克斯顿姐妹
That's why I think, Sister Barnes, Sister Paxton,

1306
01:20:26,630 --> 01:20:28,390
你们真的需要注意
that you really need to pay attention

1307
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:30,150
因为我向你保证
because I promise you...

1308
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:31,890
我们不是在谈论魔术
...we're not talking about a magic trick.

1309
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:39,510
不
No,

1310
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:41,450
我们在谈论魔法内衣
we're talking about magic underwear...

1311
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:29,080
救救我 救命
Help me! Help!

1312
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:48,760
她会回到我们身边的
She'll come back to us!

1313
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,060
我保证
I promise!

1314
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:55,630
帕克斯顿姐妹 不要害怕
Sister Paxton, do not be scared!

1315
01:21:55,630 --> 01:21:56,890
她会再次复活
She will rise again.

1316
01:21:57,460 --> 01:21:58,900
挑战他
Challenge him.

1317
01:21:58,890 --> 01:21:59,980
辩论
Debate.

1318
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:01,680
挑战他
Challenge him.

1319
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:11,820
来吧 巴恩斯姐妹
Come on, now, Sister B.

1320
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:14,380
醒醒
Wakey-wakey!

1321
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:16,690

1322
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:18,840
哇 不是那个
whoa, whoa, whoa! No, that's not it.

1323
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:21,000
不是那个 那是一只脏兮兮的小狗
That's not it. That's a... a mucky pup.

1324
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,090
让我们看看那个
Let's have that.

1325
01:22:25,530 --> 01:22:27,180
片刻 只需要片刻
Moments. It'll be moments.

1326
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:29,220
让我们来一段你的鼓点 好吗
Let's have one of your drum rolls, yeah?

1327
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:32,710
呜

1328
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:38,150

I'm very sorry.

1330
01:22:42,910 --> 01:22:44,410
出问题了
Something is wrong.

1331
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:47,940
我现在担心
I'm now worried...

1332
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:51,070
她没有
that she's not...

1333
01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:53,380
回到我们身边
...coming back to us.

1334
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:57,430
是的
Yeah.

1335
01:22:58,870 --> 01:23:00,220

1336
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:02,260

是的
Yep.

1339
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:10,450
是的
Yeah.

1340
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:11,900
就是它
There it is.

1341
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,770
不是
No, it isn't.

1342
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:16,090
那是一条静脉
That was a vein.

1343
01:23:19,190 --> 01:23:21,560
啊哈
A-ha! A-ha.

1344
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,640
植入物
The implant.

1345
01:23:26,630 --> 01:23:28,760
这就是她不能回到我们身边的原因
This is why she can't come back to us.

1346
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:30,900
看一看
Take a look!

1347
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,950
我很抱歉
I'm very sorry.

1348
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:36,990
但是巴恩斯姐妹 她是一个程序
But Sister Barnes, she's a program.

1349
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:41,610
她不是真的
She's not real.

1350
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,430
你知道是什么暴露的吗
Do you know what gave it away?

1351
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:44,910
蜡烛
The candles.

1352
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:47,480
你在说什么 我不明白
What are you saying? I don't understand.

1353
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,220
不 我知道
No, no, I know. I know. I know.

1354
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:50,960
你怎么能
How could you?

1355
01:23:56,270 --> 01:23:58,530
你能给我解释一下吗
Can you explain it to me?

1356
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:03,840
帕克斯顿姐妹 你
Are you, Sister Paxton,

1357
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:07,500
熟悉道家的概念吗
familiar with the Daoist concept

1358
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,370
“蝴蝶梦”
of "The Butterfly Dream"?

1359
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:11,240
一只蝴蝶
A butterfly...

1360
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:14,500
一只蝴蝶扇动翅膀 会引起台风吗
A butterfly flaps its wings and causes a typhoon?

1361
01:24:14,510 --> 01:24:16,030
那是“蝴蝶效应”
That is "The Butterfly Effect."

1362
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:18,510
常见的错误 不 “蝴蝶梦”
Common mistake. No. "The Butterfly Dream"...

1363
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:21,860
讲的是一位古代中国哲学家
...concerns an ancient Chinese philosopher

1364
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:23,950
他问了自己以下问题
who asked himself the following question.

1365
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:26,040
“我是梦见自己是一只蝴蝶的人吗
"Was I a man dreaming

1366
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,520
还是我现在是”
"I'm a butterfly, or am I now..."

1367
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,740
“一只梦见自己是人的蝴蝶”
"...a butterfly dreaming that I am a man?"

1368
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:33,220
过来坐下
Come and sit down.

1369
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:34,830
来吧 这里
Come on. Here.

1370
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:44,710
这是我们
This is us.

1371
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:47,400
你和我单独在一起
You and me alone together.

1372
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:48,500
那是巴恩斯
That was Barnes.

1373
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:50,280
再见 巴恩斯
Bye-bye, Barnes.

1374
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:54,540
我得出了一个黑暗的结论
I have come to a dark realization

1375
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:57,900
我们存在于一个如此先进的模拟中
that we exist inside a simulation so advanced

1376
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:00,470
以至于我们无法区分现实生活和
that we cannot tell the difference between real life

1377
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:03,160
人造梦境
and artificial dream.

1378
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:06,730
你听到了先知 她说 “这不是真的”
You heard the Prophet. She said, "It is not real."

1379
01:25:07,950 --> 01:25:10,820
你看 火的动力学很难渲染
You see, fire dynamics are very difficult to render.

1380
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:13,230
我注意到它在与模拟的 NPC
I've noticed this anomaly in its behavior

1381
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:15,660
交互时的行为异常
when it interacts with simulated NPCs,

1382
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:18,830
就像可怜的老巴恩斯姐妹
like poor old Sister B.

1383
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:23,140
她不能回到我们身边 但是当你死的时候
She couldn't come back to us, but when you die,

1384
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:26,400
手指 拜托 你将穿越死亡
finger, please, you will pass through death

1385
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,660
然后醒来
and wake up...

1386
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:31,020
进入现实世界
...into the real world.

1387
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:32,890
你怎么看
What do you think?

1388
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:34,330
是 不 也许
Yes, no, maybe?

1389
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:36,940
嗯
Um...

1390
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:41,330
那是一个理论
That's a theory.

1391
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:44,550
好吧 是的 你非常欢迎
Well yeah, you're very welcome to...

1392
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:47,380
挑战我的前提 我喜欢那样
to challenge my premise. I love that.

1393
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:50,860
来吧
Go for it.

1394
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:58,740
我不认为这是一个微芯片
I don't think this is a microchip.

1395
01:25:59,570 --> 01:26:00,660
哦
Oh?

1396
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:03,490
我认为这是一种避孕措施
I think it's a contraceptive.

1397
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:08,530
一个 节育植入物
A... a birth control implant.

1398
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:11,190
嗯
Huh.

1399
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:15,190
告诉我 你见过吗
Tell me, have you ever met

1400
01:26:15,190 --> 01:26:17,630
一个正在节育的摩门教传教士
a Mormon missionary who was on birth control?

1401
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:24,630
“巴恩斯姐妹”有没有说过她在节育
Did "Sister Barnes" say she was on birth control?

1402
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,120
我们的教会会让她
Our church would've made her

1403
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,950
感到羞耻
feel ashamed about it,

1404
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:29,550
她会感到太尴尬
and she would've been too embarrassed.

1405
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:32,600
- 模拟理论是 - 啊
- Simulation theory is... - Ah!

1406
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:35,390
“假设” 拜托 对不起 这不重要
"Hypothesis," please. Sorry, it doesn't matter.

1407
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:38,850
模拟假设
Simulation hypothesis

1408
01:26:38,850 --> 01:26:41,570
是不可测试的 对吧
is not testable, is it?

1409
01:26:43,050 --> 01:26:45,570
不 这是一种信仰问题 就像任何宗教一样
No, it's a matter of belief, like any religion.

1410
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,500
你要么相信它 绿色的门
You either believe it, green door,

1411
01:26:48,510 --> 01:26:50,530
要么你不相信它 紫色的门
or you don't believe it, purple door.

1412
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:54,280
恕我直言
With all due respect,

1413
01:26:55,450 --> 01:26:56,540
我
I...

1414
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:58,850
我不相信
I don't believe it.

1415
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:03,280
我不够聪明 无法说出原因 我只是不相信
I'm not smart enough to say why, I just don't.

1416
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:06,160
你相信我给你展示的奇迹吗
Do you believe the miracle that I showed you?

1417
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:07,930
是的
Yes.

1418
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:09,510
- 是吗 - 一开始
- Yeah? - At first.

1419
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:12,340
但现在
But now?

1420
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:15,200
我认为今晚发生了一些事情
I think something happened tonight

1421
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:17,380
你没有预料到
that you didn't expect.

1422
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:19,250
感觉你是在即兴发挥
It feels like you're improvising,

1423
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:21,740
试图让我相信一个模拟理论
trying to convince me of a simulation theory

1424
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:23,780
但这并不成立 我说得对吗
that's not sticking. Am I right?

1425
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:30,010
你是在问我 你说得对
Uh, are you asking me if you're right

1426
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:31,570
我是在即兴发挥
that I am improvising

1427
01:27:31,570 --> 01:27:34,700
还是你说得对 模拟叙事
or you're right that the simulation narrative

1428
01:27:34,710 --> 01:27:35,930
并不成立
is not sticking?

1429
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,180
是的
Yes.

1430
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,240
击掌
High-five.

1431
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:47,240
所以 事实上 你同意你朋友的观点
So, in fact, you agree with your friend.

1432
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:49,680
你认为先知只是在产生幻觉
You think that the Prophet was just hallucinating

1433
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:51,680
一个毫无意义的濒死体验
a meaningless, near-death experience.

1434
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:53,380
不
No.

1435
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:56,290
我认为你调换了尸体
I think you switched the bodies.

1436
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:00,820
我只是还没弄清楚怎么做到的
I just haven't figured out how yet.

1437
01:28:02,730 --> 01:28:03,820
我调换了
I switched...

1438
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:05,690
尸体
the bodies?

1439
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:14,050
长老到这里的时候 门铃响了
The doorbell rang when the Elder got here.

1440
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:19,350
这把我们的注意力引到了楼梯上
Which drew our attention to the stairs.

1441
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,710
你本来应该做好准备的
You would have been prepared for that.

1442
01:28:24,410 --> 01:28:26,280
当我们回到楼下时
When we came back downstairs,

1443
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:29,630
我注意到那个女人和以前的位置不一样了
I noticed the woman wasn't in the same position as before.

1444
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:30,720
很相似
It was similar...

1445
01:28:31,410 --> 01:28:32,540
她的头不一样了
Her head is different.

1446
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:34,730
但并不完全一样
But it was not the exact same.

1447
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:39,380
我认为另一个长得和她一模一样的女人
I think another woman who looked exactly like her

1448
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,950
走进了地下室
came into the basement

1449
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:43,080
通过一扇隐藏的门或其他什么
through a hidden door or something,

1450
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:46,520
处理了她的尸体 然后在桌子旁取代了她的位置
disposed of her body and then took her place at the table.

1451
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:47,950
我明白了
I see.

1452
01:28:47,950 --> 01:28:51,450
然后 一旦我们回到楼下
And then, once we got back downstairs,

1453
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:54,210
她读了一段你为她
she read off a scripted prophecy

1454
01:28:54,210 --> 01:28:56,960
准备好的预言
that you prepared for her.

1455
01:28:58,090 --> 01:29:01,830
除了她最后说的一句话
Except the last thing she said was,

1456
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,600
“这不是真的”
"It is not real."

1457
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,360
不是 真实的
...not... real...

1458
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:08,470
也许她想告诉我们
Maybe she was trying to tell us

1459
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:10,970
那个奇迹不是真的
that the miracle wasn't real.

1460
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:13,770
啊
Ah.

1461
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:16,900
你明白我说的话的意思了吧
You see what I mean when I say

1462
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:18,810
发生了你没有预料到的事情
something happened that you didn't expect?

1463
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:22,770
我认为你给了她一个剧本 她脱稿了
I think you gave her a script, and she went off the book,

1464
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:24,420
现在你正在努力挽回
and now you're trying to recover.

1465
01:29:26,510 --> 01:29:28,340
好吧 如果那是对的 那么
Well, if that's right, then, uh,

1466
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:32,170
必须有另一条路可以进入这个地下室 对吧
there'd have to be another way into this basement, yeah?

1467
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:34,350
我们要不要看看
Shall we have a look?

1468
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:42,970
我不认为有
I don't think there is.

1469
01:29:43,660 --> 01:29:44,840
不
No.

1470
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,310
我做得不太好
I'm not doing very well,

1471
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:48,760
帕克斯顿姐妹
Sister Paxton.

1472
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:50,970
除非
Unless...

1473
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:51,900
这意味着
Which means that...

1474
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:54,910
如果你是对的
there would have to be a dead body down there

1475
01:30:54,910 --> 01:30:56,610
那里应该有一具尸体
if you were right, huh?

1476
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:57,690
对
Correct.

1477
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:00,300
你将如何检验你的理论
How will you test your theory?

1478
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:02,040
我不知道
I don't know.

1479
01:31:03,310 --> 01:31:05,090
但是你会进入那个洞里
But will you go into that hole and

1480
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:07,400
看看那里有没有人吗
see if there's somebody down there?

1481
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:08,750
如果我必须
If I have to.

1482
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:10,830
你为什么要那样做
Why would you do that?

1483
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:15,240
因为我想知道真相
Because I want to know the truth,

1484
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:17,930
因为唯一的出路就是穿过
and because the only way out is through.

1485
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:20,280
罗伯特·弗罗斯特
Robert Frost?

1486
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:22,020
沼泽怪物
Swamp Thing.

1487
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:26,940
不要进入那个地窖
Don't go into that cellar...

1488
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:30,640
除非你准备好了
unless you are prepared

1489
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:32,640
去发现唯一真正的宗教
to discover the one, true religion.

1490
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:18,340
我就知道
I knew it.

1491
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:44,360
嘿
Hey.

1492
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:09,810
对不起 这么冷
Sorry about the cold.

1493
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:13,690
你弄清楚了吗
Have you figured it out yet?

1494
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:18,640
我想是的
I think so.

1495
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:21,740
那是什么
So what is it?

1496
01:35:22,870 --> 01:35:27,400
什么是唯一真正的宗教 帕克斯顿姐妹
What is the one, true religion, Sister P?

1497
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:31,490
是
It's...

1498
01:35:38,710 --> 01:35:40,450
当我们第一次到达时
When we first arrived,

1499
01:35:41,190 --> 01:35:43,280
你把我们单独留在你的客厅里
you left us alone in your living room.

1500
01:35:45,370 --> 01:35:47,680
我们以为你在和你妻子说话
We thought you were talking to your wife,

1501
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:49,990
但你在做别的事情
but you were doing something else.

1502
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:52,030
我是
I was.

1503
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:55,590
你从巴恩斯姐妹的外套里拿了一把钥匙
You took a key from Sister Barnes' coat,

1504
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:58,730
出去解锁我们的自行车并把它们藏起来
went outside to unlock our bikes and hide them.

1505
01:36:03,210 --> 01:36:05,730
我注意到你回来的时候头发是湿的
I noticed your hair was wet when you came back

1506
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:08,530
带着饮料 就像你在暴风雨中一样
with the drinks, like you were out in the storm.

1507
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,610
我猜你这样做 是因为你不想
You did this, I assume, because you didn't want

1508
01:36:10,610 --> 01:36:11,910
长老找到我们的自行车
the Elder to find our bikes

1509
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:12,920
当他回来找我们的时候
when he came back looking for us.

1510
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:15,790
但你还有别的事情要做
But there was something else on your mind.

1511
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:18,970
是的
There was.

1512
01:36:20,710 --> 01:36:22,340
你把自行车钥匙
You returned the bike key

1513
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:23,970
放回了错误的外套口袋
to the wrong coat pocket.

1514
01:36:25,150 --> 01:36:27,110
我们以为这是你犯的一个错误
We thought this was a mistake you made.

1515
01:36:27,110 --> 01:36:28,150
钥匙
Key.

1516
01:36:29,890 --> 01:36:31,630
但现在我知道不是了
But now I know it wasn't.

1517
01:36:31,630 --> 01:36:33,200
为什么
Why?

1518
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:37,850
你把自行车锁给了你的一个先知
You gave the bike lock to one of your prophets,

1519
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:41,260
指示他们用它锁上最后的地窖门
instructed them to lock the final cellar door with it.

1520
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:44,210
但是为什么 为什么 我为什么要那样做
But why, why, why? Why did I do that?

1521
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:47,260
因为你想让我知道
Because you wanted me to know

1522
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:50,260
我现在站在这里的唯一原因
the only reason I'm standing here right now

1523
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:52,040
是因为它正是
is because it is exactly

1524
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:54,090
你想让我站的地方
where you want me to be standing.

1525
01:36:55,180 --> 01:36:57,530
我在这里不是因为我选择在这里
I'm not here because I chose to be.

1526
01:36:57,530 --> 01:36:59,840
我在这里是因为你让我选择在这里
I'm here because you made me choose to be.

1527
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,710
哦
Oh.

1528
01:37:01,710 --> 01:37:05,710
因为你想让我相信 唯一真正的宗教是
Because you want me to believe the one, true religion is...

1529
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:08,970
控制
...control.

1530
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,330
完全正确
That is exactly right.

1531
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:21,860
宗教只是一种控制系统
Religion is just a system of control...

1532
01:37:24,340 --> 01:37:26,080
没关系
It's okay.

1533
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,730
我会帮助你
I'll help you.

1534
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:29,210
不 你看 这就是有趣的地方
No, you see, that's what's so interesting.

1535
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:30,820
他们不需要你的帮助
They don't want your help.

1536
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:32,650
他们正是
They... they are exactly

1537
01:37:32,650 --> 01:37:34,040
他们选择的地方
where they chose to be.

1538
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:35,430
但你杀了那个女人
But you killed that woman.

1539
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:36,740
我不同意
I disagree.

1540
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:39,180
她选择吃一个有毒的派
She... She chose to eat a poisoned pie

1541
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:41,220
因为她有深刻的信仰
because of her profound faith.
