1
0:03:13,750 --> 0:03:14,630
Good morning.

2
0:04:21,920 --> 0:04:23,460
Yuli... Come on.

3
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:26,380
Come on, bro!

4
0:04:26,670 --> 0:04:28,380
Go on, Yuli! Go on, Yuli!

5
0:04:28,920 --> 0:04:32,840
You have to win, you have to win! Come on, come on!

6
0:04:33,670 --> 0:04:34,710
We're all ready.

7
0:04:35,920 --> 0:04:36,670
Are you?

8
0:04:38,250 --> 0:04:41,380
Right, I'm coming.

9
0:04:44,300 --> 0:04:47,000
Right, folks, change of order. We'll start the street scene.

10
0:04:47,920 --> 0:04:50,000
Let's move it...

11
0:04:58,300 --> 0:04:59,250
Yuli!

12
0:05:08,250 --> 0:05:09,300
Yuli!

13
0:05:44,130 --> 0:05:44,880
Tina!

14
0:05:45,170 --> 0:05:46,550
-你看到尤利了吗? - What is it? - Have you seen Yuli?

15
0:05:46,840 --> 0:05:47,960
No, no. I haven't seen him.

16
0:05:48,960 --> 0:05:51,420
Lads, have any of you seen my son?

17
0:05:52,670 --> 0:05:54,090
Damn it!

18
0:05:55,050 --> 0:05:57,880
Cundo, I've seen you around with Yuli. Do you know where he is?

19
0:05:58,170 --> 0:05:58,920
No.

20
0:05:59,920 --> 0:06:01,460
- There we go. - Come on.

21
0:06:01,920 --> 0:06:02,960
Go on, Yuli.

22
0:06:29,500 --> 0:06:30,630
He's winning!

23
0:06:50,380 --> 0:06:52,130
Hell! Let me through!

24
0:06:52,420 --> 0:06:53,550
Hey, move over!

25
0:06:53,840 --> 0:06:54,590
Get the hell up!

26
0:06:54,880 --> 0:06:55,960
Get off him! Shit!

27
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:01,210
Come on, move it! When will you start behaving?

28
0:07:01,750 --> 0:07:04,590
Told you! I don't want you hanging around with these wasters.

29
0:07:05,170 --> 0:07:06,050
It's sore!

30
0:07:06,340 --> 0:07:08,460
-你弄疼我了, 老爸! - You want to swing your arse? - You're hurting me, Papi!

31
0:07:08,750 --> 0:07:12,130
好, 你等着, 扭屁股... That's what you want, to strut your stuff? Well, you'll see, wriggle your arse...

32
0:07:38,710 --> 0:07:39,710
Good night.

33
0:07:44,920 --> 0:07:46,840
Yuli, turn off the light.

34
0:07:57,000 --> 0:07:58,710
Mami, where are we going?

35
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:00,130
Ask your dad...

36
0:08:12,250 --> 0:08:14,590
-我们是来面试的. - Good morning. - We're here for the audition.

37
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:26,630
Boys, straighten the legs.

38
0:08:28,500 --> 0:08:31,750
Look at that, all bent! Come on! Stretch!

39
0:08:32,250 --> 0:08:34,710
It should hurt, push till it hurts! Stretch!

40
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:39,460
Look at the legs, bent again. Stretch!

41
0:08:39,840 --> 0:08:43,710
Bend down, put your head to your knees.

42
0:08:44,300 --> 0:08:45,590
Right down.

43
0:09:03,250 --> 0:09:04,420
Let's go up.

44
0:09:05,920 --> 0:09:07,210
Higher, Julia, higher.

45
0:09:08,550 --> 0:09:09,550
That's it.

46
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:14,500
So you want to be a dancer, Carlos?

47
0:09:14,800 --> 0:09:15,710
No, I don't.

48
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:17,380
- Yes, he does. - No, I don't.

49
0:09:17,670 --> 0:09:18,840
Yes, you do.

50
0:09:20,000 --> 0:09:21,170
So what do you want to be?

51
0:09:21,710 --> 0:09:22,800
A footballer, like Pele.

52
0:09:23,250 --> 0:09:29,460
I want to wear boots, not panty-tights like those faggots out there.

53
0:09:45,380 --> 0:09:48,210
Now for the last little test. Could you dance something for us,

54
0:09:48,500 --> 0:09:50,050
- anything you like? - No.

55
0:09:53,380 --> 0:09:54,050
Dance.

56
0:09:54,500 --> 0:09:55,090
No.

57
0:09:55,710 --> 0:09:58,960
If you don't, me and you will be dancing back at the house.

58
0:10:33,300 --> 0:10:34,840
Listen...

59
0:10:35,880 --> 0:10:37,880
This is one of the best ballet schools in the world.

60
0:10:38,210 --> 0:10:42,420
It's not months of discipline, years of sacrifice. It's a way of life.

61
0:10:42,710 --> 0:10:45,500
Not a job, but a vocation.

62
0:10:45,800 --> 0:10:48,500
Listen, this is how it is. We live so far out, in the outskirts.

63
0:10:49,130 --> 0:10:54,840
It takes three buses in, three buses back... Two hours each way.

64
0:10:55,130 --> 0:10:56,380
He's still a child.

65
0:10:56,800 --> 0:10:57,420
Yes.

66
0:10:57,710 --> 0:10:59,500
I'm very sleepy in the mornings.

67
0:10:59,800 --> 0:11:02,250
I began work when I was 9 years old.

68
0:11:02,550 --> 0:11:03,500
I survived.

69
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:07,920
You can get up with me in the mornings at 5. That's it!

70
0:11:08,920 --> 0:11:12,840
The whole family has to be united, totally committed to it.

71
0:11:13,170 --> 0:11:14,250
Mami and Papi are divorced.

72
0:11:14,590 --> 0:11:15,880
But we still live together.

73
0:11:16,250 --> 0:11:17,840
Like cat and dog.

74
0:11:18,840 --> 0:11:24,460
Carlos, most kids would give anything to get into this school.

75
0:11:25,380 --> 0:11:29,170
In no other place in the world would you receive ballet classes,

76
0:11:29,500 --> 0:11:33,630
schooling, all for free, even the food. It's a luxury.

77
0:11:34,340 --> 0:11:38,840
You have something special which most kids don't have,

78
0:11:39,170 --> 0:11:42,420
buckets of natural talent from head to toe.

79
0:11:42,920 --> 0:11:44,050
Let's do this.

80
0:11:44,340 --> 0:11:47,300
You head home, talk to your Mami and Papi,

81
0:11:47,710 --> 0:11:49,210
and think about it, calmly. Then we talk.

82
0:11:50,130 --> 0:11:51,250
Will you do that for me?

83
0:11:51,670 --> 0:11:52,500
No.

84
0:11:53,670 --> 0:11:54,750
Turn off the light, Yuli.

85
0:12:07,750 --> 0:12:09,130
Papi, I don't want to be a dancer.

86
0:12:10,960 --> 0:12:12,090
I want to be normal.

87
0:12:13,050 --> 0:12:14,550
Well, too bad, partner.

88
0:12:14,840 --> 0:12:18,420
My friends will drop me, call me a faggot.

89
0:12:19,210 --> 0:12:19,960
Don't worry.

90
0:12:21,250 --> 0:12:26,630
The son of a tiger has the same stripes.

91
0:12:27,130 --> 0:12:30,840
If they call you a poof, drop your pants, show them your big dick like your Dad's

92
0:12:31,130 --> 0:12:33,050
and tell them to go fuck themselves!

93
0:12:33,920 --> 0:12:39,130
You are Yuli, son of Ogun, a Warrior God.

94
0:12:39,460 --> 0:12:41,250
I gave him that nickname, not you!

95
0:12:41,550 --> 0:12:45,000
Bullshit, Berta! You weren't even there.

96
0:12:45,880 --> 0:12:49,750
I named you after an Indian brave the day you were born. Yuli!

97
0:12:50,170 --> 0:12:52,380
And you're going to be the best ballet dancer in the world.

98
0:12:52,710 --> 0:12:53,550
That's it!

99
0:12:55,050 --> 0:12:57,050
Now shut up and get to sleep, all of you.

100
0:13:02,710 --> 0:13:04,840
Carlos, I'll leave you this.

101
0:13:05,840 --> 0:13:06,630
Thanks.

102
0:13:09,130 --> 0:13:09,840
Can I?

103
0:13:10,250 --> 0:13:11,090
Yes.

104
0:13:16,210 --> 0:13:18,090
Your old man must have loved you to pieces.

105
0:13:19,130 --> 0:13:20,130
In his own way.

106
0:13:21,130 --> 0:13:22,210
On his own terms.

107
0:13:24,550 --> 0:13:29,170
One, two, push to the floor, three,

108
0:13:30,630 --> 0:13:32,800
four, stretch.

109
0:13:33,130 --> 0:13:36,000
Six, seven,

110
0:13:37,090 --> 0:13:39,800
eight... And one,

111
0:13:41,090 --> 0:13:41,840
two,

112
0:13:43,130 --> 0:13:45,090
three... Chin up!

113
0:13:45,380 --> 0:13:46,210
Four,

114
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:48,090
five,

115
0:13:49,130 --> 0:13:52,050
six, seven...

116
0:13:53,130 --> 0:13:54,380
Carlos, please.

117
0:13:56,340 --> 0:14:01,420
And one, two, three, four,

118
0:14:02,090 --> 0:14:07,130
five, six, seven, eight. Tummies in!

119
0:14:08,800 --> 0:14:10,170
Ah, Mami! Is she coming or not?

120
0:14:10,840 --> 0:14:13,840
Ah, God, you are all so impatient! She said she was coming.

121
0:14:15,300 --> 0:14:19,250
You've been saying that for over half an hour!

122
0:14:20,300 --> 0:14:21,920
Do you think we'll all fit in?

123
0:14:22,210 --> 0:14:23,380
They always take Berta.

124
0:14:23,710 --> 0:14:24,460
You're a pain.

125
0:14:24,750 --> 0:14:26,920
Listen, your aunt tries her best. That's enough.

126
0:14:37,550 --> 0:14:40,590
Children! No, no, no. Let's see how much space. Carlos!

127
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:41,840
You two, out.

128
0:14:44,590 --> 0:14:45,630
But why?

129
0:14:46,500 --> 0:14:47,960
I can only take Berta.

130
0:14:49,250 --> 0:14:50,550
We're all squeezed up too tight.

131
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:53,590
Told you! You always bring her.

132
0:14:53,920 --> 0:14:55,130
I'm really sorry...

133
0:14:55,840 --> 0:14:58,960
The next time we go to the beach, the first will be you two.

134
0:14:59,250 --> 0:15:00,130
Liar.

135
0:15:02,550 --> 0:15:04,630
Come here, darling...

136
0:15:05,210 --> 0:15:06,380
For God's sake...

137
0:15:07,920 --> 0:15:11,500
Listen, love, we have to talk about something important, very important.

138
0:15:11,800 --> 0:15:13,590
- What happened? - No, don't worry. We'll talk.

139
0:15:14,090 --> 0:15:15,050
Don't worry.

140
0:15:16,670 --> 0:15:18,090
Let's go.

141
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:38,710
I spent the afternoon with my sister.

142
0:15:41,210 --> 0:15:46,170
They're all leaving, fares paid, papers organized.

143
0:15:50,590 --> 0:15:52,840
They'll make their way to Venezuela, then to Miami.

144
0:15:54,050 --> 0:15:55,800
Perfect place for her.

145
0:15:56,130 --> 0:15:58,250
But she's taking Mum with her, Pedro.

146
0:16:08,130 --> 0:16:09,250
They...

147
0:16:13,590 --> 0:16:14,880
Mireya wants to...

148
0:16:18,250 --> 0:16:20,050
bring me and Berta with them too,

149
0:16:20,550 --> 0:16:22,960
and leave Marilin and Carlos here with you.

150
0:16:23,710 --> 0:16:24,460
What?

151
0:16:25,590 --> 0:16:26,630
What are you saying?

152
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:32,090
Pedro, if I stay, I'll never see my mother again.

153
0:16:36,880 --> 0:16:40,500
So what are you going to do? Yuli and Marilin are your children too!

154
0:16:45,800 --> 0:16:47,880
Papi, is Mami going to leave us?

155
0:16:49,550 --> 0:16:52,840
Sleep, Yuli, sleep.

156
0:16:53,670 --> 0:16:55,050
It's very late, son.

157
0:16:57,170 --> 0:16:59,000
Tell me if she is going to leave us?

158
0:17:15,750 --> 0:17:18,090
Now, faster!

159
0:17:20,300 --> 0:17:23,380
Do you hear me?

160
0:17:27,590 --> 0:17:32,170
Watch where you're going! Pay attention, in front of you, son! Watch! Watch!

161
0:17:34,090 --> 0:17:35,380
Are you drunk or something?

162
0:17:35,670 --> 0:17:36,920
Papi! We're going to crash!

163
0:17:44,550 --> 0:17:45,840
Acosta.

164
0:17:46,210 --> 0:17:47,800
Is it our surname?

165
0:18:07,340 --> 0:18:08,840
Do you see that bell up there?

166
0:18:10,630 --> 0:18:13,420
It dictated everything here in the plantation.

167
0:18:15,590 --> 0:18:16,960
The Acosta plantation.

168
0:18:18,170 --> 0:18:22,550
If a slave ran off, they hunted him down with dogs.

169
0:18:23,550 --> 0:18:29,130
An ounce of gold for each slave captured and returned.

170
0:18:29,920 --> 0:18:34,380
They prized strong black slaves like your great grandpa.

171
0:18:34,880 --> 0:18:38,170
They forced them to have sex with healthy women.

172
0:18:39,050 --> 0:18:42,170
Bred us like animals for gain.

173
0:18:44,840 --> 0:18:47,550
They lived in barracoons, eaten away by fleas,

174
0:18:48,460 --> 0:18:50,800
one door to lock them in,

175
0:18:51,590 --> 0:18:53,880
one window for air...

176
0:18:54,960 --> 0:18:57,750
They even whipped pregnant women,

177
0:18:58,460 --> 0:19:02,880
laid them down over a scooped out hole to protect their bellies.

178
0:19:03,840 --> 0:19:06,050
The cruelest treatment were the stocks.

179
0:19:06,960 --> 0:19:09,550
Thick planks with holes. They would stick their head,

180
0:19:09,840 --> 0:19:13,670
arms and feet through the planks

181
0:19:14,500 --> 0:19:16,590
and leave them there for months on end.

182
0:19:17,000 --> 0:19:18,550
How do you know all this, Papi?

183
0:19:19,500 --> 0:19:22,420
My mother, your grandmother, was born to a slave on this plantation.

184
0:19:23,250 --> 0:19:26,960
350 years of slavery runs through our veins.

185
0:19:28,210 --> 0:19:30,550
It leaves its mark.

186
0:19:31,710 --> 0:19:33,840
In our heads, in our hearts...

187
0:19:34,550 --> 0:19:35,630
Including the name.

188
0:19:36,840 --> 0:19:37,750
Acosta.

189
0:19:39,170 --> 0:19:41,920
Still dividing families to this day.

190
0:19:43,340 --> 0:19:44,840
Like me and my half-sister Berta.

191
0:19:45,630 --> 0:19:48,500
They want to bring her to Miami because she's white.

192
0:19:50,000 --> 0:19:51,590
But we survived, son.

193
0:19:52,250 --> 0:19:53,840
Even in these places

194
0:19:54,130 --> 0:19:59,170
we sang, danced, resisted, kept our Gods.

195
0:20:00,090 --> 0:20:05,550
We remember to make us stronger, more determined, hard as nails...

196
0:20:06,920 --> 0:20:08,590
We were, and we are, warriors.

197
0:20:09,000 --> 0:20:11,000
Sons of Ogun! Yuli.

198
0:20:11,500 --> 0:20:13,840
That's what we are. Warriors.

199
0:20:16,710 --> 0:20:20,210
You are beautiful, my son, inside and out.

200
0:20:21,000 --> 0:20:25,090
Nobody and nothing can hold you back. Ever.

201
0:22:53,380 --> 0:22:56,050
Take it easy, guys, you are something else.

202
0:23:00,170 --> 0:23:03,670
Carlos, this Acosta plantation, where is it?

203
0:23:03,960 --> 0:23:07,750
By Pinar del Rio, in San Juan y Martinez.

204
0:23:08,880 --> 0:23:11,840
But you know what? My father never brought me there.

205
0:23:12,170 --> 0:23:12,960
You're joking!

206
0:23:13,500 --> 0:23:14,630
Yes, it's all fiction.

207
0:23:15,000 --> 0:23:17,460
It never happened. But it is all the truth.

208
0:23:17,880 --> 0:23:21,050
My grandmother was born to a slave on the Acosta plantation.

209
0:23:22,130 --> 0:23:24,800
As a kid I used to imagine my great Grandfather as a runaway slave,

210
0:23:25,090 --> 0:23:25,960
chased by the dogs,

211
0:23:26,250 --> 0:23:29,670
fighting the hunters, stuck in the stocks, being whipped, or worse.

212
0:23:30,500 --> 0:23:32,210
My father didn't know his own father,

213
0:23:32,500 --> 0:23:36,250
his mother gave him many a beating, often cruel,

214
0:23:36,920 --> 0:23:40,420
but if all this past and present was mixed up inside the head of my old man.

215
0:23:41,170 --> 0:23:42,670
Although it didn't happen this way,

216
0:23:42,960 --> 0:23:45,920
the question is, does that mean it isn't the truth?

217
0:23:46,750 --> 0:23:50,090
But, Carlos, are you going to tell us what is reality, and what isn't?

218
0:23:51,630 --> 0:23:53,300
Do you always know the difference?

219
0:23:54,630 --> 0:23:57,960
If you are going to try and tell the story of your life, really go for it.

220
0:23:59,380 --> 0:24:03,210
You have to go deep, where the big fish lie.

221
0:24:07,920 --> 0:24:10,380
Girls, a quick goodbye. Can't wait long.

222
0:24:20,300 --> 0:24:21,840
Let's go, we could miss the plane.

223
0:24:26,590 --> 0:24:28,420
If you change your mind, it's not too late.

224
0:24:29,880 --> 0:24:32,670
We can wait for you and Berta in Venezuela.

225
0:24:32,960 --> 0:24:34,710
I can't.

226
0:24:35,000 --> 0:24:37,880
OK, Maria, OK. That's it. Time.

227
0:24:40,000 --> 0:24:42,210
- Don't forget me. - Promise me you'll take care of yourself.

228
0:24:48,960 --> 0:24:52,250
Take care. Look after yourself. I'll never forget you, my love.

229
0:25:31,130 --> 0:25:33,460
Ah, look at the fairy! Look!

230
0:25:33,750 --> 0:25:36,500
I hear you became a faggot!

231
0:25:37,630 --> 0:25:40,420
Pansy boy!

232
0:25:57,210 --> 0:25:59,800
Arms in position, legs stretched,

233
0:26:01,210 --> 0:26:05,500
lift the chin, shoulders down...

234
0:26:06,630 --> 0:26:11,170
Slowly, three, four... That's it!

235
0:26:11,460 --> 0:26:12,300
Five.

236
0:26:15,170 --> 0:26:17,840
Seven, eight...

237
0:26:18,380 --> 0:26:20,500
Turn to the bar.

238
0:26:21,170 --> 0:26:23,000
Four, don't hang on the bar.

239
0:26:28,210 --> 0:26:30,710
Carlos Acosta! Come back here immediately!

240
0:26:31,000 --> 0:26:32,550
Where's that kid going?

241
0:26:33,170 --> 0:26:34,500
Don't let him out!

242
0:26:53,460 --> 0:26:56,170
Back from there. You're going to fall.

243
0:28:16,300 --> 0:28:17,130
Yuli!

244
0:28:55,340 --> 0:28:57,920
All this was built on a private golf course.

245
0:28:58,920 --> 0:29:03,550
Fidel and Che played the last game of golf here just after the revolution.

246
0:29:04,380 --> 0:29:05,880
Fidel had the dream of transforming it

247
0:29:06,170 --> 0:29:08,840
into the most spectacular City of the Arts in the world.

248
0:29:09,630 --> 0:29:13,840
Music, dance...

249
0:29:14,460 --> 0:29:16,750
And here we are in what was to be the ballet school...

250
0:29:18,050 --> 0:29:18,920
Follow me.

251
0:29:20,590 --> 0:29:23,250
Garatti, the architect, was inspired by the spirit of the times,

252
0:29:23,960 --> 0:29:25,590
by the revolution...

253
0:29:26,050 --> 0:29:28,800
Multiple entrances and exits,

254
0:29:29,090 --> 0:29:30,920
open to possibility,

255
0:29:31,210 --> 0:29:33,840
flowing, sweeping and interconnected,

256
0:29:34,380 --> 0:29:38,300
bold and imaginative.

257
0:29:39,210 --> 0:29:41,210
I was a volunteer student working here

258
0:29:41,500 --> 0:29:44,800
till construction was cut short in '65, just a few weeks short of completion.

259
0:29:45,090 --> 0:29:46,090
Times changed.

260
0:29:46,460 --> 0:29:48,670
We had the Bay of Pigs,

261
0:29:49,250 --> 0:29:54,250
sabotage, assassination attempts, the economic embargo, hardship...

262
0:29:55,130 --> 0:29:58,050
The Soviets moved in, political space shrank.

263
0:30:00,960 --> 0:30:04,920
All this designated "non productive" by the Russian advisors

264
0:30:05,800 --> 0:30:07,050
and never used.

265
0:30:09,000 --> 0:30:13,210
It's so sad, one of the most inspiring buildings in the world falling to pieces.

266
0:30:13,500 --> 0:30:15,420
Is it possible to rebuild it?

267
0:30:17,920 --> 0:30:21,460
Hey, kid! What a fright you gave me! Who are you?

268
0:30:22,250 --> 0:30:23,170
Rambo.

269
0:30:26,210 --> 0:30:31,500
PRISON COMBINADO DEL ESTE

270
0:30:51,340 --> 0:30:54,630
I'll get out soon, don't worry.

271
0:30:55,840 --> 0:30:56,960
It'll all work out fine.

272
0:30:58,920 --> 0:31:00,090
How's your Mami?

273
0:31:00,500 --> 0:31:03,130
Don't worry, Papi, we're taking good care of her.

274
0:31:03,960 --> 0:31:04,750
Aren't we?

275
0:31:05,050 --> 0:31:06,550
- Yes. - Yes.

276
0:31:07,130 --> 0:31:08,800
I'm so proud of you all.

277
0:31:09,630 --> 0:31:11,460
And you, Berta, how are you?

278
0:31:12,500 --> 0:31:13,250
Fine.

279
0:31:13,750 --> 0:31:15,460
- And you, Marilin? - Fine.

280
0:31:16,800 --> 0:31:19,920
Fine, fine... Is that all you can tell me?

281
0:31:20,380 --> 0:31:21,500
We had to sell the fridge.

282
0:31:21,800 --> 0:31:24,050
What? The fridge?

283
0:31:26,550 --> 0:31:27,710
Shit!

284
0:32:07,050 --> 0:32:07,960
Faggot!

285
0:32:08,550 --> 0:32:11,090
You bloody clown, go fuck yourself!

286
0:32:13,300 --> 0:32:13,920
Screw you!

287
0:32:14,210 --> 0:32:15,300
Carlos Acosta!

288
0:32:17,130 --> 0:32:19,250
The concert starts in 40 minutes!

289
0:32:19,880 --> 0:32:20,960
Look at yourself!

290
0:32:22,050 --> 0:32:23,090
Move it!

291
0:32:23,670 --> 0:32:24,590
Open the door.

292
0:32:24,880 --> 0:32:28,840
Look at your hands! Don't dare touch a thing. A mud bath!

293
0:32:29,130 --> 0:32:30,170
You're stinking, filthy!

294
0:32:31,670 --> 0:32:32,920
You promised to come!

295
0:32:34,050 --> 0:32:35,840
Are you not ashamed of yourself?

296
0:32:36,840 --> 0:32:38,670
Letting us down and your classmates.

297
0:32:39,750 --> 0:32:40,840
Let me see your face.

298
0:32:43,000 --> 0:32:44,800
And your Dad? Just you wait!

299
0:32:45,880 --> 0:32:47,840
When he finds out?!

300
0:32:48,590 --> 0:32:51,590
We were calling his work. Nobody knew anything.

301
0:32:52,380 --> 0:32:53,300
He's in prison.

302
0:32:53,800 --> 0:32:54,710
- What? - What!

303
0:32:55,130 --> 0:32:56,920
I'm up to here with your stories!

304
0:32:57,380 --> 0:32:59,090
Such a liar, you've missed half the classes

305
0:32:59,380 --> 0:33:00,710
and always ready with a new excuse!

306
0:33:01,000 --> 0:33:01,710
It's not a lie.

307
0:33:02,630 --> 0:33:05,300
A motorbike crashed into the back of Papi's lorry.

308
0:33:06,130 --> 0:33:10,840
The boy was killed, and they blamed Papi.

309
0:33:17,840 --> 0:33:18,840
And your Mami?

310
0:33:20,840 --> 0:33:21,960
And your Mami, Carlos?

311
0:33:22,590 --> 0:33:23,590
She's ill.

312
0:33:25,920 --> 0:33:29,420
I'm sorry, sweetheart, really sorry.

313
0:33:31,000 --> 0:33:32,550
But you know what we can do now?

314
0:33:33,210 --> 0:33:35,800
We can take a photo, eh?

315
0:33:36,090 --> 0:33:39,840
You can show it to your parents and it'll cheer them up.

316
0:33:40,250 --> 0:33:40,880
Look.

317
0:33:41,630 --> 0:33:43,840
You are going to look gorgeous.

318
0:33:44,840 --> 0:33:46,300
I'll look like a faggot.

319
0:33:55,170 --> 0:33:56,840
Move it! Run!

320
0:33:57,380 --> 0:34:00,300
Come on, Carlos, run, you're so late!

321
0:34:07,500 --> 0:34:11,880
At last! Here he is! Silence! Silence! In position!

322
0:34:14,170 --> 0:34:15,250
You're a disaster.

323
0:34:15,800 --> 0:34:16,710
And you stink!

324
0:34:21,920 --> 0:34:23,630
Holy shit, boy!

325
0:34:25,840 --> 0:34:30,050
Look at the way you hold yourself, that neck, the smile...

326
0:34:30,920 --> 0:34:33,130
Real talent, my God.

327
0:34:34,670 --> 0:34:36,420
Born to dance, son.

328
0:34:37,380 --> 0:34:38,750
I played the main role.

329
0:34:39,050 --> 0:34:40,800
Tell me, are you going to your classes?

330
0:34:41,090 --> 0:34:43,380
Yes. Up at the crack of dawn.

331
0:34:43,670 --> 0:34:44,880
Don't want to let you down.

332
0:34:45,170 --> 0:34:47,840
And I'm in the top 5 best students of the school.

333
0:34:48,840 --> 0:34:51,460
You don't say... And are you on time?

334
0:34:51,920 --> 0:34:56,090
Yes. They say it's the biggest turnaround in the history of the school.

335
0:34:56,380 --> 0:35:00,630
- Even the teachers can hardly believe it. - Yuli, are you telling me the truth?

336
0:35:00,920 --> 0:35:01,840
Yes.

337
0:35:04,090 --> 0:35:05,800
Come here, son.

338
0:35:07,800 --> 0:35:10,960
Come here I said... Come.

339
0:35:16,380 --> 0:35:18,210
I'm so proud of you, my boy.

340
0:35:20,880 --> 0:35:25,460
You're going to be great one day, son. Right up there, damn it.

341
0:35:26,210 --> 0:35:28,420
The Gods answered my prayers.

342
0:35:28,920 --> 0:35:30,460
What a load of bullshit!

343
0:35:30,800 --> 0:35:33,300
I was talking and talking and couldn't stop.

344
0:35:34,590 --> 0:35:36,050
I just tried to cheer him up.

345
0:35:36,590 --> 0:35:37,840
"Biggest turnaround"!

346
0:35:38,710 --> 0:35:41,670
When he gets out and learns the truth, he's going to kill you.

347
0:35:42,210 --> 0:35:43,500
You're dead.

348
0:36:40,630 --> 0:36:41,500
Come here!

349
0:36:45,000 --> 0:36:45,800
There!

350
0:37:00,880 --> 0:37:01,840
Pedro!

351
0:37:03,550 --> 0:37:04,920
Leave him, Pedro!

352
0:37:07,500 --> 0:37:10,000
- Pedro, please! - Papi, leave him!

353
0:37:11,710 --> 0:37:13,840
Pedro, leave him! You're going to kill him.

354
0:37:18,460 --> 0:37:19,420
Leave him!

355
0:37:19,920 --> 0:37:21,090
Pedro!

356
0:37:22,920 --> 0:37:25,460
You're killing my child...

357
0:37:25,750 --> 0:37:26,800
Stop it, Papi!

358
0:37:27,090 --> 0:37:27,960
Open the door!

359
0:37:31,300 --> 0:37:32,800
Open the door, for God's sake!

360
0:37:33,340 --> 0:37:34,170
Open the door!

361
0:37:37,800 --> 0:37:39,670
What did he do to you, love?

362
0:37:40,250 --> 0:37:41,130
It's OK.

363
0:37:42,340 --> 0:37:43,920
I'm here, my love.

364
0:37:53,920 --> 0:37:55,920
My love...

365
0:37:56,880 --> 0:37:59,300
It's OK, my love... OK.

366
0:38:00,210 --> 0:38:02,500
Son of a bitch! I hate you!

367
0:39:12,340 --> 0:39:14,500
Chery, this doesn't make sense for anyone.

368
0:39:14,800 --> 0:39:17,840
For the teachers, for the students, nor for him.

369
0:39:22,210 --> 0:39:27,300
Look, there is a serious problem of truancy and suspensions.

370
0:39:27,750 --> 0:39:29,800
That's the problem, Carlos, you just don't want to dance.

371
0:39:30,090 --> 0:39:32,170
- Yes, he does! - Let the boy answer for himself! Please!

372
0:39:32,460 --> 0:39:36,170
This child was born to dance! He just doesn't know it yet!

373
0:39:36,500 --> 0:39:38,590
Do you ever listen to your son?

374
0:39:39,500 --> 0:39:43,880
You have to understand the family situation has been tough.

375
0:39:44,460 --> 0:39:46,630
Pedro has just been released from prison

376
0:39:47,000 --> 0:39:49,130
and Carlos has been cared for by his two sisters,

377
0:39:49,420 --> 0:39:51,670
practically children themselves.

378
0:39:51,960 --> 0:39:55,000
I understand all that... My opinion is that we are just wasting time.

379
0:39:57,090 --> 0:39:59,710
We won't cross paths with a boy like this again.

380
0:40:03,840 --> 0:40:07,920
Pedro, can you give us a few minutes, please, and wait outside?

381
0:40:11,550 --> 0:40:15,710
For a man like me, this is very difficult...

382
0:40:17,960 --> 0:40:22,380
I'm going to beg for the first and last time in my life.

383
0:40:25,500 --> 0:40:26,750
I know what is inside him.

384
0:40:28,840 --> 0:40:34,210
I beg you to give this child one last chance.

385
0:40:37,630 --> 0:40:38,550
Let's go.

386
0:41:01,300 --> 0:41:03,300
When I was 25

387
0:41:04,630 --> 0:41:06,210
one day I sneaked into the cinema.

388
0:41:08,380 --> 0:41:10,960
On a big silver screen...

389
0:41:12,250 --> 0:41:15,170
there were delicate figures like parasols up there...

390
0:41:16,460 --> 0:41:19,130
Suddenly they made mighty leaps,

391
0:41:20,840 --> 0:41:22,000
full of strength...

392
0:41:23,590 --> 0:41:25,090
It all got me, deep inside.

393
0:41:26,090 --> 0:41:27,420
I didn't know what it was.

394
0:41:28,750 --> 0:41:32,250
I forgot my work and my shitty life.

395
0:41:34,880 --> 0:41:38,960
I felt it here, in my chest, as if it was part of me.

396
0:41:40,920 --> 0:41:42,630
The police arrived,

397
0:41:44,090 --> 0:41:46,050
they dragged me out and gave a beating.

398
0:41:47,500 --> 0:41:49,300
Blacks couldn't go to the cinema.

399
0:41:50,210 --> 0:41:52,960
I fought back and they beat me with their truncheons.

400
0:41:54,500 --> 0:41:55,960
Yuli,

401
0:41:57,050 --> 0:42:00,500
I would prefer to take a beating every day for the rest of my life...

402
0:42:02,300 --> 0:42:04,840
than see you waste your talent.

403
0:42:14,250 --> 0:42:16,130
There's no sense in him staying here.

404
0:42:17,460 --> 0:42:21,000
But there is one last chance to continue dancing.

405
0:42:22,460 --> 0:42:23,250
An ESBEC.

406
0:42:23,550 --> 0:42:24,250
What's that?

407
0:42:24,670 --> 0:42:26,000
A boarding school in the countryside.

408
0:42:26,500 --> 0:42:27,630
Pinar del Rio.

409
0:42:27,920 --> 0:42:30,960
Drag me from home? No, Papi! Tell her no!

410
0:42:31,630 --> 0:42:34,210
I've got a home... I want to stay here.

411
0:42:34,500 --> 0:42:37,710
Carlos, this is your last chance.

412
0:42:38,000 --> 0:42:41,920
No! No, Papi! Tell her no!

413
0:42:42,210 --> 0:42:45,750
Most of us, son, are "stuck".

414
0:42:46,590 --> 0:42:47,380
Not you...

415
0:42:47,670 --> 0:42:48,420
Tell her no!

416
0:42:48,710 --> 0:42:52,130
You have a star to follow.

417
0:42:52,670 --> 0:42:54,460
Carlos, they'll treat you well.

418
0:42:56,750 --> 0:42:59,460
Papi, tell her no! Please!

419
0:43:00,960 --> 0:43:02,800
Chery, thank you.

420
0:43:03,250 --> 0:43:05,170
I'll never forget what you are doing for my son.

421
0:45:19,840 --> 0:45:22,460
Mario, this part...

422
0:45:25,300 --> 0:45:28,630
I want you to open up. Understand?

423
0:45:29,170 --> 0:45:34,250
Really go for it, raw, hard... really hurts inside, get me?

424
0:45:34,550 --> 0:45:37,750
Pain... loneliness...

425
0:45:38,050 --> 0:45:39,880
Do you know how I put it?

426
0:45:40,840 --> 0:45:42,250
"That Wednesday feeling".

427
0:45:42,550 --> 0:45:46,460
Wednesday was the only day families could visit their kids.

428
0:45:46,920 --> 0:45:50,590
But my father was always away in his lorry, my mother was ill...

429
0:45:50,880 --> 0:45:52,670
I felt so alone in the enormity of it all.

430
0:45:52,960 --> 0:45:56,130
It's a loneliness I've felt all my life,

431
0:45:56,420 --> 0:45:58,960
even today as a man, it's inside.

432
0:46:00,130 --> 0:46:02,050
Loneliness never really leaves you.

433
0:46:28,670 --> 0:46:30,550
Acosta! Acosta!

434
0:46:30,840 --> 0:46:31,960
That's mine!

435
0:46:32,710 --> 0:46:34,960
What are you doing snooping in my locker? Acosta!

436
0:47:12,670 --> 0:47:15,670
Silence, please, silence.

437
0:47:20,000 --> 0:47:25,170
This morning, as a priority, we are going to deal with a serious situation.

438
0:47:29,130 --> 0:47:32,500
A number of students have been witnesses and denounced the incident.

439
0:47:32,800 --> 0:47:35,960
But we are going to listen to the pioneer who has something to say. OK?

440
0:47:37,550 --> 0:47:39,880
Carlos Acosta, we are all waiting for you.

441
0:47:43,670 --> 0:47:46,380
Tell your classmates. What are you?

442
0:47:53,130 --> 0:47:54,710
You're a thief!

443
0:47:55,000 --> 0:47:57,050
- And you're filthy! - And stink too!

444
0:50:35,140 --> 0:50:39,640
Lausanne

445
0:50:40,880 --> 0:50:43,460
Come on... Give it to them.

446
0:50:52,960 --> 0:50:54,710
Look at that!

447
0:50:55,000 --> 0:50:55,840
Look at his face.

448
0:50:57,050 --> 0:51:03,250
Fuck! Fuck! Always at the key moment...

449
0:51:03,550 --> 0:51:05,050
Fucking piece of shit!

450
0:51:09,670 --> 0:51:10,800
Fuck!

451
0:51:17,840 --> 0:51:18,880
So many of them...

452
0:51:19,340 --> 0:51:21,670
He's going to win...

453
0:51:21,960 --> 0:51:22,750
Quiet! Damn it!

454
0:51:27,170 --> 0:51:27,960
Look!

455
0:51:28,300 --> 0:51:31,090
He's done it!

456
0:51:31,920 --> 0:51:33,880
I told you! I told you!

457
0:51:38,840 --> 0:51:41,590
We've got to celebrate!

458
0:51:43,840 --> 0:51:45,500
Yuli's won the World Cup!

459
0:51:45,800 --> 0:51:48,420
Your son... Your son... He cracked it.

460
0:51:49,750 --> 0:51:52,840
It's about Yuli, Berta, he won a really important prize in Switzerland.

461
0:51:53,840 --> 0:51:54,840
Do you understand?

462
0:51:56,960 --> 0:51:58,130
Do you understand?

463
0:52:03,630 --> 0:52:06,250
This is like the first black man on the moon!

464
0:52:10,000 --> 0:52:12,380
There were about 500 competitors!

465
0:52:12,670 --> 0:52:15,170
But when the black boy appeared... He nailed it! Game over!

466
0:52:17,880 --> 0:52:18,590
Yuli!

467
0:52:22,840 --> 0:52:23,920
That's great, Mami.

468
0:52:27,710 --> 0:52:29,880
He'll spend his life far away from us now.

469
0:52:31,710 --> 0:52:32,800
Just like Mami.

470
0:53:29,750 --> 0:53:32,090
Very good, Carlos, much better.

471
0:53:32,460 --> 0:53:36,920
But remember in the second part, with more power, more.

472
0:53:37,550 --> 0:53:38,880
OK, now the duo.

473
0:53:39,670 --> 0:53:41,460
Isabelle, come on.

474
0:53:43,250 --> 0:53:44,000
Thank you, teacher.

475
0:56:37,050 --> 0:56:40,670
"GOLDEN MULATO WINS SCHOLARSHIP IN TURIN"

476
0:56:43,750 --> 0:56:46,300
Come on, Pedro, we're about to finish.

477
0:56:53,130 --> 0:56:54,800
How are you all doing?

478
0:56:56,300 --> 0:56:57,380
How are you?

479
0:57:10,920 --> 0:57:11,840
Are we going?

480
0:57:14,500 --> 0:57:16,210
I wish Papi and Mami could see this.

481
0:57:18,590 --> 0:57:21,380
My sisters, my friends, everybody...

482
0:57:24,710 --> 0:57:26,170
How did all this happen, teacher?

483
0:57:27,380 --> 0:57:28,550
The public...

484
0:57:31,500 --> 0:57:32,800
Every seat full...

485
0:57:34,170 --> 0:57:35,920
Eyes fixed on you...

486
0:57:36,250 --> 0:57:40,840
Moments of wonder that will stick in their memories for ever...

487
0:57:42,000 --> 0:57:43,800
The music, colour,

488
0:57:44,210 --> 0:57:47,460
light, youth,

489
0:57:48,300 --> 0:57:49,420
beauty...

490
0:57:51,130 --> 0:57:53,380
A privilege to have this life, Carlos.

491
0:57:55,630 --> 0:57:58,210
You can become a great dancer.

492
0:57:59,960 --> 0:58:03,170
I know that... but the question is, can you become a great artist?

493
0:58:03,670 --> 0:58:05,800
Teacher, I'm working as hard as I can.

494
0:58:06,090 --> 0:58:07,380
I don't mean that.

495
0:58:10,500 --> 0:58:13,630
It's what you carry inside.

496
0:58:15,000 --> 0:58:16,090
Who you are.

497
0:58:17,340 --> 0:58:20,460
How deep you're prepared to go inside yourself...

498
0:58:22,210 --> 0:58:23,920
And the courage you have.

499
0:58:25,960 --> 0:58:28,960
- Bye. See you tomorrow. - Bye. See you tomorrow.

500
0:58:31,170 --> 0:58:34,880
One last thing before we leave... London.

501
0:58:35,550 --> 0:58:38,460
London? What about London?

502
0:58:39,710 --> 0:58:43,710
The English National Ballet has offered you a contract.

503
0:58:45,590 --> 0:58:46,500
What?

504
0:58:48,920 --> 0:58:50,300
A contract in London?

505
0:58:50,590 --> 0:58:51,170
Yes.

506
0:58:51,960 --> 0:58:56,840
They have the best schools, the best dancers, the best teachers...

507
0:58:57,170 --> 0:58:57,960
Thank you.

508
0:58:58,250 --> 0:59:00,170
No, teacher, I didn't mean that.

509
0:59:01,500 --> 0:59:03,300
I don't think I'm good enough...

510
0:59:03,590 --> 0:59:04,170
Carlos...

511
0:59:05,380 --> 0:59:11,250
Talent, intelligence, and determination... you can't buy them.

512
0:59:11,960 --> 0:59:13,380
They are free, darling.

513
0:59:17,460 --> 0:59:19,050
Mami says you are to come quick.

514
0:59:19,340 --> 0:59:20,750
- Yuli is on the phone. - What's wrong?

515
0:59:21,050 --> 0:59:22,420
Don't know.

516
0:59:24,300 --> 0:59:26,500
What can I do in England with no English?

517
0:59:26,800 --> 0:59:30,710
Dancing, eating, fucking, you don't need grammar for all that!

518
0:59:31,000 --> 0:59:32,500
What happened? What's he saying?

519
0:59:32,800 --> 0:59:35,710
They want him as a Principal Dancer at the English National Ballet in London.

520
0:59:36,000 --> 0:59:37,840
And the bloody clown wants to come back home.

521
0:59:38,130 --> 0:59:40,630
Papi, you don't know how the Cuban National Ballet could react.

522
0:59:40,920 --> 0:59:44,840
Just in case you haven't looked in the mirror recently, you're black!

523
0:59:45,130 --> 0:59:46,710
A chance of a lifetime!

524
0:59:47,000 --> 0:59:49,710
A black man seizes a prize like this in two hands,

525
0:59:50,000 --> 0:59:51,920
and never lets go even if they try to kill him!

526
0:59:52,210 --> 0:59:53,750
Papi, I'm going to miss you all so much.

527
0:59:54,050 --> 0:59:54,800
No, Papi.

528
0:59:55,090 --> 0:59:58,050
Shit! Forget about us, forget everything...

529
0:59:58,340 --> 0:59:59,340
Forget Cuba...

530
0:59:59,630 --> 1:00:01,880
No, Papi. You know I can't do that.

531
1:00:02,170 --> 1:00:04,840
The best way to help us is to move on.

532
1:00:05,460 --> 1:00:09,630
Listen, one day this country will lay out the red carpet for you.

533
1:00:10,460 --> 1:00:11,590
How's Berta?

534
1:00:11,880 --> 1:00:12,710
Berta?

535
1:00:14,000 --> 1:00:15,170
Berta's fine.

536
1:00:15,500 --> 1:00:19,210
We're all fine, perfect, don't worry about us, son.

537
1:00:19,550 --> 1:00:22,050
Papi, you know I can't do that, don't ask me that.

538
1:00:22,340 --> 1:00:25,840
Do what you're told. Here's your Mami.

539
1:00:26,840 --> 1:00:28,840
When are you coming home, son?

540
1:00:29,380 --> 1:00:31,170
Holy shit!

541
1:00:32,840 --> 1:00:35,130
You accept the contract, accept the ticket.

542
1:00:36,170 --> 1:00:37,550
But did you get permission from Cuba?

543
1:00:38,300 --> 1:00:41,300
I've decided you go straight to London from Turin.

544
1:00:41,710 --> 1:00:43,420
But, teacher, did you ask permission?

545
1:00:44,090 --> 1:00:47,710
I'll sort it out when I get back. If you go back home...

546
1:00:48,000 --> 1:00:50,590
They'll crucify you! No, no, no! Call you a traitor at the very least!

547
1:00:50,880 --> 1:00:52,750
No, no, I'm coming back with you.

548
1:00:53,920 --> 1:00:57,630
Andres Williams. You know who I'm talking about?

549
1:00:58,130 --> 1:01:01,380
One of the greatest I ever saw...

550
1:01:02,130 --> 1:01:05,050
but black. No Romeo for him.

551
1:01:05,920 --> 1:01:09,050
You could be in a queue for a lifetime waiting your turn...

552
1:01:09,590 --> 1:01:11,090
or you can break new ground.

553
1:01:11,380 --> 1:01:13,380
Teacher, they could kick you of your job.

554
1:01:13,880 --> 1:01:16,420
Or even worse, cast aside.

555
1:01:16,960 --> 1:01:18,050
Let me worry about that.

556
1:01:18,340 --> 1:01:19,840
No, teacher, no!

557
1:01:20,710 --> 1:01:24,380
This moment could change your life for ever.

558
1:01:24,800 --> 1:01:27,920
You might not get a chance like this again, Carlos.

559
1:01:37,130 --> 1:01:39,920
If something happens to you, teacher, I'll never forgive myself.

560
1:01:40,460 --> 1:01:43,880
If you don't use that talent, I'll never forgive myself.

561
1:01:46,500 --> 1:01:48,170
Teacher. I'm scared.

562
1:01:53,000 --> 1:01:54,000
Carlos...

563
1:01:56,210 --> 1:01:58,670
Dancers dance,

564
1:01:59,710 --> 1:02:01,170
but artists take risks.

565
1:02:01,590 --> 1:02:04,840
Feel like I have the whole of Cuba on my back, teacher.

566
1:02:05,130 --> 1:02:06,130
I don't want to let her down.

567
1:02:06,960 --> 1:02:11,090
You have the right to fail, that's how you learn.

568
1:02:12,000 --> 1:02:15,460
It's a great achievement to have been accepted, enjoy it, darling.

569
1:02:34,840 --> 1:02:38,840
Londres

570
1:03:32,840 --> 1:03:34,340
Welcome! Colleague. How's your trip?

571
1:03:35,580 --> 1:03:36,580
Nice to meet you!

572
1:03:38,940 --> 1:03:40,940
Guys, this is your new colleague.

573
1:06:24,880 --> 1:06:25,880
Leave me alone.

574
1:06:26,960 --> 1:06:29,880
We found her naked screaming in the street.

575
1:06:33,920 --> 1:06:36,050
They mentioned schizophrenia.

576
1:07:26,590 --> 1:07:29,590
Havana, more than three decades after the revolution,

577
1:07:29,640 --> 1:07:32,940
An island nation 90 miles off the coast of Florida.

578
1:07:32,960 --> 1:07:36,260
A nation on the verge of economic collapse.

579
1:07:36,750 --> 1:07:39,670
We will have to instruct the Border Guards

580
1:07:39,960 --> 1:07:41,750
not to block the exit

581
1:07:42,050 --> 1:07:44,420
to crafts wanting to travel to the USA.

582
1:07:45,920 --> 1:07:47,920
The shelters of food ration are empty.

583
1:07:48,880 --> 1:07:53,880
And families are forced to carefully plan their meals base on what the goverment gives them

584
1:07:54,240 --> 1:07:57,240
and what they can buy on the black market.

585
1:07:59,280 --> 1:08:02,880
This is a world where people are hungry for the essentials of life.

586
1:08:03,480 --> 1:08:08,480
Nowhere are the needs more apparents within the poorest quarters of Havana.

587
1:08:11,090 --> 1:08:14,630
Go ahead, seat the girl first. The girl goes first.

588
1:08:15,170 --> 1:08:18,710
I have nothing to feed my kids with. I have to feed them.

589
1:08:22,040 --> 1:08:25,540
How many perished on the crossing, nobody knows.

590
1:08:43,300 --> 1:08:44,380
Thank you.

591
1:09:01,300 --> 1:09:03,880
My friend, can you give me a few coins?

592
1:09:04,670 --> 1:09:06,550
Kid, do you not remember me? I'm Yuli!

593
1:09:10,250 --> 1:09:11,460
It's me, Yuli.

594
1:09:13,670 --> 1:09:14,590
Yuli!

595
1:09:16,380 --> 1:09:19,550
Look, everybody, it's Yuli!

596
1:09:24,300 --> 1:09:26,130
Ah, my son!

597
1:09:26,420 --> 1:09:29,840
Ah, Mami. How are you?

598
1:09:30,130 --> 1:09:31,460
Ah, my child!

599
1:09:32,170 --> 1:09:33,920
How I've missed you, Mami.

600
1:09:35,250 --> 1:09:37,590
Let me see you... So handsome.

601
1:09:38,920 --> 1:09:39,840
How's Berta?

602
1:09:41,590 --> 1:09:42,920
Berta is better, love.

603
1:09:43,500 --> 1:09:45,210
Tomorrow we'll see her in hospital.

604
1:09:50,750 --> 1:09:51,800
Darling!

605
1:09:57,000 --> 1:09:58,170
Look at him.

606
1:10:08,550 --> 1:10:10,500
Is it true it's always raining?

607
1:10:11,590 --> 1:10:12,590
Almost.

608
1:10:12,880 --> 1:10:15,670
But the worst is the cold and damp.

609
1:10:15,960 --> 1:10:18,550
So how's your foot, Yuli?

610
1:10:21,960 --> 1:10:23,050
They gave you stitches?

611
1:10:23,340 --> 1:10:25,880
They removed a bone splinter. Seven stitches.

612
1:10:28,590 --> 1:10:29,960
It hurt like hell...

613
1:10:30,250 --> 1:10:34,420
That's nothing. In military service I fucked my ankle... Look.

614
1:10:36,050 --> 1:10:38,210
As far as I know, you are not a ballet dancer, is that right?

615
1:10:41,840 --> 1:10:42,710
How did it happen?

616
1:10:43,460 --> 1:10:45,420
One day during a rehearsal...

617
1:10:45,880 --> 1:10:50,000
I was a bit homesick, feeling down...

618
1:10:50,380 --> 1:10:52,000
Thinking about you all...

619
1:10:52,500 --> 1:10:53,880
I lost concentration and landed badly.

620
1:10:56,710 --> 1:10:57,800
"Feeling down".

621
1:10:58,340 --> 1:10:59,710
- Papi... - Great...

622
1:11:00,000 --> 1:11:01,380
- Enough. - "Down".

623
1:11:01,670 --> 1:11:02,800
Please, he's just landed.

624
1:11:03,340 --> 1:11:08,000
Moaning, moaning... Missing this, missing that...

625
1:11:08,460 --> 1:11:09,460
Papi, what's wrong?

626
1:11:09,750 --> 1:11:14,880
Too wet, too cold, too dark... Fuck me!

627
1:11:15,210 --> 1:11:16,630
Pedro!

628
1:11:17,300 --> 1:11:21,050
Risking your whole career for nostalgic bullshit!

629
1:11:21,630 --> 1:11:25,420
I told you to forget about us!

630
1:11:25,750 --> 1:11:28,090
All you care about is this fucking pigsty!

631
1:11:28,670 --> 1:11:32,710
Sometimes I wonder if you deserve your God-given talent!

632
1:11:33,000 --> 1:11:33,840
Talent!

633
1:11:35,920 --> 1:11:38,710
Fucking talent dragged me from home age 1 1!

634
1:11:39,210 --> 1:11:40,550
Against my will.

635
1:11:41,250 --> 1:11:45,250
And so you know, I don't care if I ever dance again! I hate it!

636
1:11:45,880 --> 1:11:47,000
Hate it!

637
1:11:48,920 --> 1:11:51,460
I lost my life to fucking ballet!

638
1:11:55,750 --> 1:11:59,590
Did you ever ask yourself what makes me happy? Me! Eh?

639
1:12:00,670 --> 1:12:05,550
- Has that ever passed through your brain? - Happiness? What the fuck is happiness?

640
1:12:05,840 --> 1:12:10,420
To be with my family, with Mami, with you,

641
1:12:10,710 --> 1:12:12,210
taking care of my sisters...

642
1:12:12,880 --> 1:12:13,920
To feel needed.

643
1:12:14,800 --> 1:12:16,000
An ordinary life.

644
1:12:17,590 --> 1:12:19,050
A family, a home.

645
1:12:19,460 --> 1:12:20,590
Dance is your home.

646
1:12:21,550 --> 1:12:25,050
- Art is your home. - You stole my childhood.

647
1:12:25,550 --> 1:12:27,840
How sweet. Sentimental hokum

648
1:12:28,380 --> 1:12:32,380
for the feeble minded! You've learned fuck all.

649
1:12:34,250 --> 1:12:35,710
Papi, sometimes I hate you...

650
1:12:36,380 --> 1:12:38,130
- What are you saying? - I hate you, that's the truth.

651
1:12:39,710 --> 1:12:41,590
Well, you listen to me.

652
1:12:42,880 --> 1:12:45,710
I prefer hate to the very last day of your life,

653
1:12:47,460 --> 1:12:50,300
instead of your soppy bullshit, bonehead.

654
1:12:51,380 --> 1:12:52,340
Fuck off!

655
1:12:52,630 --> 1:12:53,500
What?

656
1:12:56,750 --> 1:13:00,420
Be careful... or I'll split you in two.

657
1:13:02,300 --> 1:13:05,500
Careful, Yuli, careful.

658
1:13:25,150 --> 1:13:27,950
General Major Smedley D. Butler  US Marine Corps 1881-1940

659
1:13:28,840 --> 1:13:33,340

High class muscle man, for Big Business, Big Business, for Wall Street, for Bankers, for Wall Street.

663
1:13:54,200 --> 1:14:02,200
May Mexico save her American Standard Oil, save her American Oil. Save!

664
1:14:03,220 --> 1:14:12,220
May, hey, Cuba, Cuba, Cuba, a decent place for National City Bank.

665
1:14:12,250 --> 1:14:16,250
Bankers, Bankers, National City Bankers.

666
1:14:18,840 --> 1:14:26,840
Racketeer, Gangster, Rat, Central America for Wall Street! Wall Street!

667
1:14:28,240 --> 1:14:36,240

IR Chan alcohol, three districts for him, three continents for me.

1:14:58,860 --> 1:15:01,060
Racketeer, Gangster.

671
1:15:05,320 --> 1:15:08,320
Sucker, US military sucker.

672
1:15:08,840 --> 1:15:11,340
My worlds, my life.

673
1:15:11,840 --> 1:15:18,840
General Smedley D. Butler, Smedley, Smedley

674
1:15:20,080 --> 1:15:21,080
Smedley

675
1:15:21,100 --> 1:15:22,100
Smedley

676
1:15:23,120 --> 1:15:29,120
Smedley

677
1:15:46,840 --> 1:15:48,500
Right, folks, I've got some notes for you.

678
1:15:48,800 --> 1:15:50,710
What's this, Carlos? Another of your inventions?

679
1:15:51,000 --> 1:15:52,130
What inventions?

680
1:15:52,500 --> 1:15:55,300
Smedley existed, and those are his very words.

681
1:15:55,670 --> 1:15:57,170
Sorry, Carlos, I'm trying to think,

682
1:15:57,460 --> 1:15:59,420
but I don't see what it has to do with your life.

683
1:16:00,750 --> 1:16:03,630
Good, you keep thinking and I'll keep rehearsing.

684
1:16:03,920 --> 1:16:08,130
Let's move on. Julio, this time it was spectacular.

685
1:16:25,340 --> 1:16:26,670
Don't stop, you dickhead. Go on!

686
1:16:26,960 --> 1:16:30,090
- Listen to me. Ignore them. Listen to me. - Stop, stop.

687
1:16:30,380 --> 1:16:31,550
Where are your papers?

688
1:16:32,380 --> 1:16:34,960
Opito, the glove compartment, grab the papers.

689
1:16:35,250 --> 1:16:36,710
I won't give these fuckers a single penny.

690
1:16:37,000 --> 1:16:38,880
I'm not giving them a penny... Going to give them some bars of soap.

691
1:16:39,170 --> 1:16:40,250
I'd give them fuck all.

692
1:16:40,550 --> 1:16:42,750
Opito, I've got more at home, give me the soap.

693
1:17:00,210 --> 1:17:02,170
- Good evening. - Good evening.

694
1:17:02,920 --> 1:17:04,750
Just a moment.

695
1:17:09,050 --> 1:17:11,420
- Good evening, good evening. - Can I go in or not?

696
1:17:12,710 --> 1:17:13,630
Good evening.

697
1:17:16,250 --> 1:17:18,880
- It's full to capacity. - Where are these people going to?

698
1:17:20,670 --> 1:17:22,420
Shut for us, not for them.

699
1:17:22,750 --> 1:17:23,920
Who owns the country?

700
1:17:24,300 --> 1:17:26,750
Cubans, or these fucking tourists?

701
1:17:27,050 --> 1:17:28,550
Look, son, keep out of trouble.

702
1:17:28,840 --> 1:17:30,380
- Hands off me! Don't touch me! - Mind yourself.

703
1:17:30,670 --> 1:17:31,840
- Please, leave now. - Don't touch me!

704
1:17:32,750 --> 1:17:33,800
We're going in.

705
1:17:39,550 --> 1:17:41,420
- Cool it, boys. - Opito, easy, one second.

706
1:17:42,300 --> 1:17:43,750
Tell me, what do you want?

707
1:17:44,340 --> 1:17:46,090
Listen, man, damn, we're brothers, or not?

708
1:17:46,500 --> 1:17:47,710
We are... So what?

709
1:17:48,000 --> 1:17:50,380
Listen, all we want to do is kick back,

710
1:17:50,670 --> 1:17:53,630
relax a little in the hotel... Give us a break, eh?

711
1:17:53,920 --> 1:17:56,750
Maybe this will help...

712
1:17:57,050 --> 1:17:58,130
What is this?

713
1:17:59,130 --> 1:18:00,710
Just a little something to keep you going...

714
1:18:01,000 --> 1:18:02,590
Are you trying to bribe a state functionary?

715
1:18:02,880 --> 1:18:06,210
Not a bribe, just a little help.

716
1:18:06,500 --> 1:18:08,000
Piss off to Miami!

717
1:18:16,430 --> 1:18:20,300
What a prick! And these guys here? Eh?

718
1:18:20,460 --> 1:18:24,670
And this low-life who came to screw our youngsters, fuck our children?

719
1:18:25,300 --> 1:18:28,000
And you treat them like lords! You're a cheap scumbag!

720
1:18:28,800 --> 1:18:30,550
Let's go.

721
1:19:18,130 --> 1:19:22,500
After you've been away so long, you're not from here, nor from there...

722
1:19:23,670 --> 1:19:24,590
Well...

723
1:19:26,090 --> 1:19:27,960
How long are you going to stay?

724
1:19:34,130 --> 1:19:35,750
Do you know what really gets me?

725
1:19:37,170 --> 1:19:40,840
Kids begging in the street, from me, as if I were a stranger.

726
1:19:44,670 --> 1:19:46,960
I must be the only Cuban who wants to stay here.

727
1:19:48,340 --> 1:19:51,590
Everybody I speak to wants to leave.

728
1:20:00,670 --> 1:20:03,090
Opito and Ramon are building a raft to get out.

729
1:20:07,300 --> 1:20:08,550
Have they gone mad?

730
1:20:11,170 --> 1:20:12,920
Brother, you're not chancing it.

731
1:20:13,710 --> 1:20:17,550
- Don't preach to me, no sermons... - No fucking way, no, brother, no way.

732
1:20:17,840 --> 1:20:20,550
Don't preach to me.

733
1:20:21,170 --> 1:20:26,710
Easy to preach in your fancy cloths, with your cash, you can travel...

734
1:20:27,000 --> 1:20:29,710
Totally mad! What the fuck's going on? Are you crazy?

735
1:20:30,300 --> 1:20:32,090
It's no bed of roses outside Cuba...

736
1:20:32,550 --> 1:20:33,420
Isn't?

737
1:20:34,210 --> 1:20:38,550
If you don't have money or contacts, they treat you like shit, a nobody.

738
1:20:39,880 --> 1:20:42,090
If you get ill, you'll drop dead, nobody bothers...

739
1:20:42,380 --> 1:20:43,050
And here?

740
1:20:44,340 --> 1:20:45,420
And here, Yuli?

741
1:20:46,050 --> 1:20:47,300
It's a shithole, brother!

742
1:20:48,380 --> 1:20:52,460
You have choices, you can live from your work, as it should be.

743
1:20:52,840 --> 1:20:53,590
Not me.

744
1:20:55,380 --> 1:20:57,920
I work like a dog day and night,

745
1:20:58,210 --> 1:21:01,210
up and down on my taxi-bike... My family are starving.

746
1:21:01,840 --> 1:21:04,090
I leave home every morning and I don't know

747
1:21:04,380 --> 1:21:07,420
if I'll be able to bring them back something to eat...

748
1:21:07,750 --> 1:21:09,090
But there's got to be another way, brother.

749
1:21:09,380 --> 1:21:11,590
What other ways? Tell me?

750
1:21:11,960 --> 1:21:15,880
Every time I see the leaders of this fucking mess on TV,

751
1:21:16,170 --> 1:21:17,800
fattening themselves like pigs...

752
1:21:18,090 --> 1:21:20,840
and me, like a prick up and down on my taxi bike. Every day.

753
1:21:21,960 --> 1:21:22,920
So what other way?

754
1:21:24,300 --> 1:21:26,750
The only thing I have in the whole world to gamble with...

755
1:21:28,000 --> 1:21:31,590
The only thing I can count on, that's really mine,

756
1:21:33,130 --> 1:21:34,590
is my life.

757
1:21:46,380 --> 1:21:48,550
Give me some time, brother, and I'll help you...

758
1:21:49,050 --> 1:21:53,710
Leave it, forget all this shit, brother.

759
1:21:54,000 --> 1:21:56,000
Where's that white chick? She's gorgeous.

760
1:22:26,210 --> 1:22:27,670
Fucking shithole!

761
1:22:28,670 --> 1:22:31,090
Is there no way to have a good time here?

762
1:22:34,670 --> 1:22:36,550
No more lights... Once again...

763
1:24:10,090 --> 1:24:11,800
You don't answer my calls.

764
1:24:15,340 --> 1:24:16,420
And you're fat.

765
1:24:17,750 --> 1:24:18,630
Thank you.

766
1:24:19,500 --> 1:24:21,130
Your father has been calling me.

767
1:24:22,300 --> 1:24:23,500
You've broken his heart.

768
1:24:23,880 --> 1:24:24,880
He's got a heart?

769
1:24:27,920 --> 1:24:29,710
Ah, teacher... I've got my life back.

770
1:24:31,550 --> 1:24:32,420
I'm fine.

771
1:24:33,460 --> 1:24:34,880
Yes, so I see.

772
1:24:38,550 --> 1:24:42,130
Are you not ashamed to throw it all away?

773
1:24:43,170 --> 1:24:45,380
Teacher, I've enjoyed myself more in these last few months

774
1:24:45,670 --> 1:24:47,880
than in my whole life! That's it!

775
1:24:49,880 --> 1:24:51,300
And when the money runs out?

776
1:24:52,880 --> 1:24:55,500
Look, even if I wanted to,

777
1:24:56,800 --> 1:24:57,800
which I don't,

778
1:24:59,170 --> 1:25:00,590
I don't know if my ankle will take it.

779
1:25:00,880 --> 1:25:03,710
- You won't know till you try. - Teacher, it's over!

780
1:25:04,000 --> 1:25:06,630
I've given ballet all I've got. It's done!

781
1:25:10,090 --> 1:25:11,300
And Houston Ballet?

782
1:25:13,050 --> 1:25:14,380
The United States?

783
1:25:20,840 --> 1:25:23,590
You know they won't give me permission here to work there.

784
1:25:26,000 --> 1:25:27,300
Maybe you're right...

785
1:25:30,380 --> 1:25:33,500
Teacher, who wants me there?

786
1:25:37,250 --> 1:25:39,050
You said your ankle wouldn't take it?

787
1:25:39,340 --> 1:25:40,250
Damn it, tell me!

788
1:25:40,590 --> 1:25:41,710
A good man.

789
1:25:42,000 --> 1:25:44,420
An excellent choreographer and director.

790
1:25:46,840 --> 1:25:49,670
I want to see you for rehearsal tomorrow morning at the studio.

791
1:25:52,750 --> 1:25:55,420
And it's not just about you.

792
1:25:55,710 --> 1:25:59,090
Here we go again, the whole of Cuba on my back.

793
1:25:59,550 --> 1:26:04,000
Listen, boy, a little consideration for others,

794
1:26:04,380 --> 1:26:06,800
we have given you everything, for nothing in return!

795
1:26:07,840 --> 1:26:10,590
Shit! Sometimes I want to knock your head off!

796
1:26:10,880 --> 1:26:12,090
What a brute you are!

797
1:26:13,800 --> 1:26:14,920
And if I can't?

798
1:26:18,920 --> 1:26:20,250
If I'm not good enough?

799
1:26:23,880 --> 1:26:25,000
Listen, Carlos...

800
1:26:26,880 --> 1:26:29,840
Sometimes in life things don't work out as we hope.

801
1:26:32,380 --> 1:26:37,460
All you can do, son, is work hard like you always have done.

802
1:26:39,550 --> 1:26:41,420
I'll see you in the studio tomorrow morning.

803
1:27:01,840 --> 1:27:03,550
The Director will receive you in a moment.

804
1:27:06,050 --> 1:27:08,380
HEAD OF THE NATIONAL CUBAN BALLET

805
1:27:09,670 --> 1:27:10,590
Two.

806
1:27:11,920 --> 1:27:12,750
One,

807
1:27:13,500 --> 1:27:15,050
and two.

808
1:27:15,550 --> 1:27:16,460
To the bar.

809
1:27:17,920 --> 1:27:20,880
Five, six,

810
1:27:21,590 --> 1:27:24,340
seven, ready, eight.

811
1:27:24,630 --> 1:27:26,050
And one.

812
1:27:27,500 --> 1:27:28,800
Hey, kid, come here.

813
1:27:31,590 --> 1:27:32,630
Are you Carlos Acosta?

814
1:27:33,340 --> 1:27:34,210
Yes.

815
1:27:34,500 --> 1:27:35,500
I saw you on the TV.

816
1:27:36,000 --> 1:27:37,050
That's why I'm here.

817
1:27:37,670 --> 1:27:38,710
Have you come to give a class?

818
1:27:39,000 --> 1:27:39,840
No, kid.

819
1:27:41,590 --> 1:27:43,750
He's off to the big league.

820
1:27:47,750 --> 1:27:48,800
OK, to your class.

821
1:27:49,800 --> 1:27:51,050
No skiving and work!

822
1:28:18,710 --> 1:28:20,170
Silence, please.

823
1:28:25,340 --> 1:28:28,300
Papi, if she doesn't give me permission, I won't go.

824
1:28:29,130 --> 1:28:30,750
- Yuli... - No, Papi, no.

825
1:28:31,500 --> 1:28:33,550
If she doesn't give me permission, I won't be allowed back home.

826
1:28:34,920 --> 1:28:36,500
That would kill me, Papi.

827
1:28:58,750 --> 1:29:02,750
HOUSTON BALLET PROUDLY PRESENTS CARLOS ACOSTA

828
1:32:10,850 --> 1:32:18,850
The Royal Ballet presents Principal  Dancer Carlos Acosta

829
1:37:01,350 --> 1:37:06,790
THE FIRST BLACK ROMEO IN THE ROYAL BALLET, MY SON YULI

830
1:37:46,340 --> 1:37:47,170
Teacher...

831
1:37:51,050 --> 1:37:51,960
Thanks for coming.

832
1:37:52,920 --> 1:37:55,460
I came to wish you luck.

833
1:37:56,670 --> 1:37:58,960
Ah, teacher, like always. Like always.

834
1:38:07,750 --> 1:38:12,380
All the tickets sold out, half of Havana will be here tomorrow.

835
1:38:15,090 --> 1:38:17,130
Just wish your Papi could have been here.

836
1:38:18,340 --> 1:38:19,840
Remember him in Soho?

837
1:38:21,460 --> 1:38:23,380
He was so proud of you.

838
1:39:53,460 --> 1:39:58,130
There are three secrets of why we are here today in London.

839
1:39:59,590 --> 1:40:04,840
First, this lady, and all the rice and beans she gave him as a boy.

840
1:40:08,250 --> 1:40:09,590
Second,

841
1:40:10,500 --> 1:40:11,800
his talent,

842
1:40:13,000 --> 1:40:14,210
which he inherited from me.

843
1:40:16,340 --> 1:40:21,710
And third, Chery, and the Cuban School of ballet.

844
1:40:22,670 --> 1:40:24,300
For a black kid like him,

845
1:40:24,590 --> 1:40:28,250
son of a black lorry driver like me, grandson of a slave,

846
1:40:29,050 --> 1:40:32,130
he would have survived the roaring fires of hell

847
1:40:32,880 --> 1:40:34,800
before getting into ballet school anywhere else.

848
1:40:38,920 --> 1:40:40,050
My son,

849
1:40:41,090 --> 1:40:42,840
I have a confession to make.

850
1:40:44,670 --> 1:40:46,300
I know that I made you suffer, so much.

851
1:40:48,130 --> 1:40:50,500
After years of sacrifice,

852
1:40:51,300 --> 1:40:55,050
today you are an artist, you followed your star.

853
1:40:56,500 --> 1:40:57,500
Your friends here tell me

854
1:40:57,800 --> 1:41:00,300
that when you retire from dance they want you to stay here.

855
1:41:03,840 --> 1:41:05,380
London will be your home,

856
1:41:06,880 --> 1:41:09,420
your base to conquer the world.

857
1:41:14,630 --> 1:41:17,210
The happiest day of my life was the day you were born.

858
1:41:23,460 --> 1:41:24,420
Let's toast.

859
1:41:29,210 --> 1:41:33,000
Thank you everyone, especially my child Yuli,

860
1:41:36,210 --> 1:41:38,300
named after a warrior, son of Ogun.

861
1:42:09,340 --> 1:42:13,920
YOUR KIDS WILL NOT FORGET YOU

862
1:42:48,500 --> 1:42:49,550
Thank you, Papi.

863
1:42:51,750 --> 1:42:52,960
But you were wrong.

864
1:42:55,210 --> 1:42:56,420
London is not my home.

865
1:42:58,380 --> 1:42:59,420
I am from here.

866
1:43:01,050 --> 1:43:05,550
I've founded my company here, and one day I'll open up that old school.

867
1:43:08,500 --> 1:43:10,800
I can only give, what I am.

868
1:43:12,210 --> 1:43:13,590
I am your son,

869
1:43:14,920 --> 1:43:19,000
son of Pedro Acosta, the lorry driver Pedro Acosta.

870
1:43:20,630 --> 1:43:21,840
Son of Ogun,

871
1:43:23,710 --> 1:43:26,550
that's me, who I am.

872
1:45:48,840 --> 1:46:16,840
that's me, who I am.
