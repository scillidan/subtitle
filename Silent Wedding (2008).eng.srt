1
0:00:38,500 --> 0:00:41,440
No! No! No!

2
0:00:58,360 --> 0:01:01,030
Madam, you are unwell.

3
0:01:01,370 --> 0:01:04,220
She needs a hot dinner, brother Chimney.

4
0:01:04,220 --> 0:01:06,380
I saw her first, brother Joliffe.

5
0:01:10,110 --> 0:01:12,750
Do not tire yourself, sir.

6
0:01:13,030 --> 0:01:15,520
We travel before first peep of day.

7
0:01:18,410 --> 0:01:20,860
Well, Madam...what say you?

8
0:01:33,830 --> 0:01:36,600
What has been your business in Oxford, sir?

9
0:01:37,290 --> 0:01:39,600
To sell corn, my dear.

10
0:01:39,610 --> 0:01:40,810
You're a farmer?

11
0:01:42,060 --> 0:01:47,060
I sell corn...which is a mite easier than growing the stuff.

12
0:01:47,950 --> 0:01:50,230
No armies trample over my profits.

13
0:01:50,230 --> 0:01:52,940
And the King's court must still be fed.

14
0:02:01,500 --> 0:02:03,180
Shall I call the boy?

15
0:02:03,400 --> 0:02:05,560
You want me drunk, madam?

16
0:02:06,320 --> 0:02:09,170
I knew it were so!

17
0:02:09,550 --> 0:02:12,900
Such a bonny lady, such a fine face,

18
0:02:13,400 --> 0:02:17,450
but we must all eat, must we not?!

19
0:02:17,760 --> 0:02:20,860
In times as these, a man must make hard bargains...

20
0:02:21,420 --> 0:02:24,610
and a woman must sell what a man will buy.

21
0:02:24,730 --> 0:02:26,050
Shall I call the boy?

22
0:02:26,050 --> 0:02:29,170
No, dear Madam... for I am lusty enough.

23
0:02:32,120 --> 0:02:33,590
Come, come.

24
0:02:33,950 --> 0:02:35,790
You've had your pay.

25
0:02:50,020 --> 0:02:52,050
Come, let me help you.

26
0:02:53,540 --> 0:02:55,060
Sir, I beg of you.

27
0:02:55,350 --> 0:02:57,410
Oh, no, no, no,

28
0:02:57,750 --> 0:02:59,460
we'll have no tears.

29
0:02:59,620 --> 0:03:01,150
For we are jolly here.

30
0:03:04,070 --> 0:03:08,200
Now off with the rest, open your pretty legs and all is done.

31
0:03:08,200 --> 0:03:12,060
Sir, I think you have a wife somewhere.

32
0:03:12,210 --> 0:03:14,490
I beg you think.

33
0:03:18,120 --> 0:03:19,840
Madam. No more of this.

34
0:03:26,610 --> 0:03:28,650
Will you run me through?

35
0:03:29,360 --> 0:03:31,110
I think you will not.

36
0:03:32,620 --> 0:03:35,010
Madam, will you get on your back?

37
0:03:36,480 --> 0:03:38,720
Well, then I see you need another smack.

38
0:03:54,010 --> 0:03:55,870
Oh, God!

39
0:03:56,800 --> 0:03:58,930
Do not call for God, sir.

40
0:04:04,590 --> 0:04:07,380
He's turned his face from us both.

41
0:04:15,850 --> 0:04:17,680
The country starves, Thomas.

42
0:04:17,840 --> 0:04:21,310
But Oliver,there is food enough for those with coin to pay for it.

43
0:04:21,320 --> 0:04:23,400
Parliament men sign themselves passes

44
0:04:23,400 --> 0:04:26,360
through my lines and sell corn to our enemies in Oxford.

45
0:04:26,450 --> 0:04:28,770
The country looks to the Army for justice.

46
0:04:28,950 --> 0:04:30,870
The country looks for order.

47
0:04:31,010 --> 0:04:32,730
They want their King back in his place.

48
0:04:32,730 --> 0:04:34,490
They want their world safe again.

49
0:04:35,330 --> 0:04:36,910
You know my mind on that.

50
0:04:38,080 --> 0:04:39,360
What is yours?

51
0:04:40,130 --> 0:04:42,840
We are as one, and ever will be.

52
0:04:42,840 --> 0:04:44,690
But Charles Stuart will ever be King.

53
0:04:44,690 --> 0:04:47,830
How can Charles Stuart be King and the world be safe?

54
0:04:49,330 --> 0:04:51,550
God will provide us the answer.

55
0:04:52,570 --> 0:04:55,970
The starving copyholder nor the unpaid soldier will not wait

56
0:04:56,050 --> 0:04:56,980
for the firmament to split

57
0:04:56,980 --> 0:04:58,760
and shine God's beam on us, Oliver!

58
0:04:58,860 --> 0:05:00,950
We must make our own light shine.

59
0:05:01,050 --> 0:05:05,030
On the King, on the parliament of thieves and on property.

60
0:05:05,110 --> 0:05:06,410
Property?

61
0:05:06,730 --> 0:05:08,540
Land should be a common treasury.

62
0:05:08,540 --> 0:05:10,080
Let every man have a share of it

63
0:05:10,080 --> 0:05:12,650
and there'll be no starving. Men will feed themselves.

64
0:05:12,650 --> 0:05:14,540
Where's that land to come from?

65
0:05:14,540 --> 0:05:16,800
It must be taken from those who have too much.

66
0:05:20,770 --> 0:05:22,660
You would have us turn to robbery then?

67
0:05:23,880 --> 0:05:25,080
Farewell, Colonel.

68
0:05:28,030 --> 0:05:29,480
Farewell, General.

69
0:05:30,670 --> 0:05:32,250
Why did these members of parliament...

70
0:05:32,250 --> 0:05:34,620
induce us to fight in the name of freedom...

71
0:05:35,010 --> 0:05:36,830
only that we might now endure their greed

72
0:05:36,830 --> 0:05:38,260
or suffer their prisons?

73
0:05:38,260 --> 0:05:41,190
I tell ya, this is no freedom except for them!

74
0:05:41,620 --> 0:05:44,510
And where sat they while we fought for their profits?

75
0:05:44,510 --> 0:05:47,080
At home counting their money.

76
0:05:47,080 --> 0:05:49,660
I tell ya, we are robbed once more.

77
0:05:49,740 --> 0:05:53,600
Not by King alone this time, but by parliament as well!

78
0:05:53,740 --> 0:05:55,190
Voice of the people, John.

79
0:05:55,190 --> 0:05:56,420
Let them! Let them come!

80
0:05:56,420 --> 0:05:58,090
Let them come.

81
0:06:00,580 --> 0:06:01,560
Comrades!

82
0:06:02,050 --> 0:06:04,960
We fought side by side for liberty!

83
0:06:05,220 --> 0:06:07,960
What did you fight for all that time?

84
0:06:07,980 --> 0:06:10,960
To be the dogs that parliament would throw me to?

85
0:06:11,430 --> 0:06:15,670
Incarcerate me, sirs, I am a free born man!

86
0:06:44,580 --> 0:06:46,300
Try again.

87
0:07:36,210 --> 0:07:41,930
Sexby. I was told you were dead at Kineton fight.

88
0:07:43,340 --> 0:07:47,120
Death indeed sought me out. Like a lover.

89
0:07:47,270 --> 0:07:48,680
But yet I live.

90
0:07:49,950 --> 0:07:50,980
I thank you.

91
0:07:50,980 --> 0:07:52,650
God in heaven...

92
0:07:53,920 --> 0:07:56,090
help me, please!

93
0:07:59,320 --> 0:08:01,400
You are much changed, my Lady.

94
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:06,750
You are not, I see.

95
0:08:09,910 --> 0:08:11,010
Where to?

96
0:08:13,130 --> 0:08:16,920
Tonight I know not.

97
0:08:17,460 --> 0:08:22,220
Tomorrow, London. There to make a new beginning.

98
0:08:23,980 --> 0:08:25,870
It'll be dark soon.

99
0:08:26,290 --> 0:08:27,810
They'll not have gone far.

100
0:08:29,130 --> 0:08:34,960
There's rabbit.

101
0:08:46,200 --> 0:08:47,880
How did your husband die?

102
0:08:51,080 --> 0:08:53,520
He died because I was not tame.

103
0:08:56,840 --> 0:08:58,640
The world would have you tame.

104
0:09:06,760 --> 0:09:08,760
Then the world is full of fools.

105
0:09:13,960 --> 0:09:17,120
How came you by those clothes?

106
0:09:17,120 --> 0:09:18,480
A man gave them to me.

107
0:09:23,840 --> 0:09:25,840
I killed a man.

108
0:09:27,600 --> 0:09:30,040
Nothing remains of who I was.

109
0:09:35,760 --> 0:09:40,960
At Axholme, where I was born, men came to drain the fens

110
0:09:40,960 --> 0:09:45,160
and when the water flowed away, they found men...

111
0:09:47,760 --> 0:09:51,120
..buried in the peat. Like this.

112
0:09:51,120 --> 0:09:54,360
Hands tied to legs. Holes here...

113
0:09:54,360 --> 0:09:56,000
Stones or hammers...

114
0:10:00,120 --> 0:10:01,640
And a black god...

115
0:10:04,400 --> 0:10:08,760
..made in wood, kept perfect in the ground.

116
0:10:11,360 --> 0:10:13,800
Where is that god now, I wonder?

117
0:10:16,480 --> 0:10:19,400
If all his worshippers are buried in the ground with him,

118
0:10:20,440 --> 0:10:22,160
is he still a god then?

119
0:10:26,480 --> 0:10:28,840
If a King runs away from his country,

120
0:10:30,440 --> 0:10:32,360
is he still a King then?

121
0:10:33,440 --> 0:10:35,600
He left England?

122
0:10:35,600 --> 0:10:38,560
He gave himself to the Scots,

123
0:10:38,560 --> 0:10:41,560
hoping for a new Army, they say.

124
0:10:41,560 --> 0:10:43,320
But the Scots know a bargain.

125
0:10:45,200 --> 0:10:47,360
They've sold him to the parliament.

126
0:10:49,960 --> 0:10:51,720
How can you laugh?

127
0:10:51,720 --> 0:10:56,360
I thought Charles Stuart King, God and Father once.

128
0:10:58,960 --> 0:11:00,840
Madam.

129
0:11:00,840 --> 0:11:02,700
We enter the world alone and in blood

130
0:11:02,700 --> 0:11:04,600
and leave the same way.

131
0:11:05,280 --> 0:11:09,160
What happens in between means little.

132
0:11:19,240 --> 0:11:21,320
I will be no man's whore.

133
0:11:33,080 --> 0:11:36,960
Do nothing but sit by the fire

134
0:11:36,960 --> 0:11:38,600
and look like a feast.

135
0:11:46,680 --> 0:11:49,480
Look what I found on the road to London.

136
0:11:51,200 --> 0:11:53,680
A whore in a dead man's shirt.

137
0:11:53,680 --> 0:11:54,840
Take his clothes from her.

138
0:12:02,960 --> 0:12:06,600
You will pay with your own life, for that of my friend.

139
0:12:06,600 --> 0:12:08,240
But first...

140
0:12:08,240 --> 0:12:10,040
Lay her down.

141
0:12:26,800 --> 0:12:28,360
Or would you rather I kill him?

142
0:12:28,360 --> 0:12:31,040
You're the devil, sir.

143
0:12:31,040 --> 0:12:33,750
And you, madam, the devil's whore.

144
0:12:34,610 --> 0:12:36,340
Enough, enough killing.

145
0:12:36,400 --> 0:12:38,640
The devil's whore gives the orders.

146
0:12:38,920 --> 0:12:41,210
What times we live in.

147
0:12:41,210 --> 0:12:45,400
Go home, sir, to your wife.

148
0:12:47,830 --> 0:12:50,730
Your money will go to the poor whose taxes you live on.

149
0:12:51,080 --> 0:12:54,090
A whore and a Leveller too,

150
0:12:54,640 --> 0:12:57,000
well may you prosper as Master Lilburne does.

151
0:12:57,000 --> 0:12:59,080
Walled up in stone.

152
0:12:59,080 --> 0:13:00,960
By whose order?

153
0:13:00,960 --> 0:13:02,400
By the parliament.

154
0:13:04,840 --> 0:13:06,520
We will meet again, madam.

155
0:13:14,400 --> 0:13:17,520
"Free Born" John walled up again.

156
0:13:17,520 --> 0:13:19,600
His wife will need money.

157
0:13:21,480 --> 0:13:24,720
Then I see you have found another God to worship.

158
0:13:24,720 --> 0:13:29,000
The Holy Trinity - truth, liberty and justice.

159
0:13:31,360 --> 0:13:34,040
And what is that but more blood?

160
0:13:34,040 --> 0:13:36,590
And tell me, when all the blood is spilled,

161
0:13:37,300 --> 0:13:38,710
what then?

162
0:13:39,510 --> 0:13:42,350
Who will be master and who will be slave?

163
0:13:43,440 --> 0:13:44,880
Will I be King?

164
0:13:46,960 --> 0:13:49,030
Will my lady work in the fields?

165
0:13:49,030 --> 0:13:53,580
There is a madness in you that feeds on the times, Sexby.

166
0:13:53,960 --> 0:13:55,880
Do not laugh at me, sir.

167
0:13:58,560 --> 0:14:01,520
Between blood of birth and blood of death there is life.

168
0:14:03,160 --> 0:14:05,760
And this fight is now my life.

169
0:14:06,740 --> 0:14:08,100
What is yours?

170
0:14:09,860 --> 0:14:11,340
To laugh at hope?

171
0:14:13,260 --> 0:14:15,020
To live and die alone?

172
0:14:16,720 --> 0:14:18,160
Nay.

173
0:14:21,100 --> 0:14:23,420
I would not have that life.

174
0:14:34,540 --> 0:14:35,500
Turn your back.

175
0:14:37,340 --> 0:14:39,220
I wish to dress in my skirts again.

176
0:14:40,660 --> 0:14:41,860
Must you?

177
0:14:45,420 --> 0:14:47,460
Must I what, sir?

178
0:14:48,780 --> 0:14:50,340
Put on your clothes?

179
0:14:57,940 --> 0:14:59,420
I mean only to swim.

180
0:15:04,020 --> 0:15:06,420
Swim naked with me, madam...

181
0:15:11,420 --> 0:15:14,380
..And we will both take gold to Honest John.

182
0:15:16,940 --> 0:15:19,140
He can have my share too.

183
0:15:19,140 --> 0:15:21,420
All I ask is that you swim with me.

184
0:15:30,880 --> 0:15:32,840
Stand off.

185
0:15:55,600 --> 0:15:57,240
Will you not swim, Sexby?

186
0:15:59,320 --> 0:16:00,880
I never could swim.

187
0:16:07,170 --> 0:16:08,990
From a friend in the Parliament you say?

188
0:16:08,990 --> 0:16:09,920
Indeed.

189
0:16:10,990 --> 0:16:13,160
I knew not I had a friend in the Parliament.

190
0:16:14,080 --> 0:16:17,390
John, 28 pounds.

191
0:16:17,390 --> 0:16:18,890
Enough to buy a new printing press.

192
0:16:18,890 --> 0:16:21,170
And some clothes for the children.

193
0:16:21,640 --> 0:16:24,640
Aye, a new press.

194
0:16:26,280 --> 0:16:29,200
I thought the fight had lost you, Edward.

195
0:16:29,200 --> 0:16:30,960
No, John.

196
0:16:30,960 --> 0:16:33,970
The fight will never lose me again.

197
0:16:33,980 --> 0:16:35,180
My sword is drawn.

198
0:16:38,460 --> 0:16:39,940
This is the fight now.

199
0:16:41,260 --> 0:16:42,540
Words?

200
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:46,060
Read.

201
0:16:58,220 --> 0:17:00,060
You hold his life in your hands.

202
0:17:01,300 --> 0:17:03,460
Both sides will call it treason.

203
0:17:04,340 --> 0:17:07,420
"Parliament to be forcibly adjourned

204
0:17:07,420 --> 0:17:09,740
"and a new one elected by all men of good faith,

205
0:17:09,740 --> 0:17:12,540
"not only those with property."

206
0:17:12,640 --> 0:17:16,760
The levelling up of men cannot begin until this is accomplished.

207
0:17:17,940 --> 0:17:21,900
"That new Parliament to have Charles Stuart...

208
0:17:23,630 --> 0:17:25,190
"..Arrested."

209
0:17:27,620 --> 0:17:29,900
"And tried as a man of blood..."

210
0:17:34,660 --> 0:17:36,580
Who will do the levelling up?

211
0:17:36,580 --> 0:17:39,580
The army, Edward. Where you should be still.

212
0:17:39,580 --> 0:17:42,860
There is no other engine to drive the world's turning but the army.

213
0:17:54,260 --> 0:17:55,900
Will you take these pages out?

214
0:17:55,900 --> 0:17:57,830
They must find their way to a press.

215
0:17:58,570 --> 0:18:00,390
I am searched.

216
0:18:00,740 --> 0:18:02,620
Even my skirts.

217
0:18:02,620 --> 0:18:04,370
The dogs.

218
0:18:11,940 --> 0:18:14,140
Where is the press?

219
0:18:14,140 --> 0:18:16,380
At your house, madam,

220
0:18:16,380 --> 0:18:18,340
with Thomas Rainsborough.

221
0:18:27,440 --> 0:18:30,160
We must search you, sir. On my master's orders.

222
0:18:32,120 --> 0:18:34,200
And who is your master?

223
0:18:34,200 --> 0:18:35,680
That you need not know.

224
0:18:48,040 --> 0:18:50,280
Madam?

225
0:18:52,440 --> 0:18:54,280
Go, madam!

226
0:19:23,010 --> 0:19:24,210
Where is she?

227
0:19:37,120 --> 0:19:39,520
This was my mother's chapel.

228
0:19:46,560 --> 0:19:51,040
My, er, soldiers are godly men.

229
0:19:51,040 --> 0:19:53,880
They will not tolerate idolatry.

230
0:19:54,900 --> 0:19:59,300
My mother worshipped her God through painted clay.

231
0:20:02,840 --> 0:20:05,400
I am glad to see you safe and well, madam.

232
0:20:05,400 --> 0:20:08,840
These two years I tried for news of you many times.

233
0:20:08,840 --> 0:20:11,480
I feared you were sick.

234
0:20:11,480 --> 0:20:12,520
Or worse.

235
0:20:13,610 --> 0:20:15,890
I was never more alive.

236
0:20:19,760 --> 0:20:22,360
From Honest John.

237
0:20:33,560 --> 0:20:35,120
We are in your debt.

238
0:20:36,480 --> 0:20:39,440
This house is given to the army for a while.

239
0:20:39,440 --> 0:20:42,280
Though I must make free with a part of it,

240
0:20:42,280 --> 0:20:44,240
the rest is yours.

241
0:21:10,240 --> 0:21:12,120
How fares Joshua?

242
0:21:12,120 --> 0:21:13,720
Madam?

243
0:21:14,390 --> 0:21:16,760
God sent these floods to trap you.

244
0:21:16,760 --> 0:21:18,330
Now he sends you Rainsborough and Cromwell,

245
0:21:18,330 --> 0:21:20,000
like Joshua and Gideon

246
0:21:20,320 --> 0:21:21,950
to drown you in fire and blood.

247
0:21:23,390 --> 0:21:25,150
You broke a King's heart.

248
0:21:25,810 --> 0:21:28,360
And killed some innocents too, madam.

249
0:21:28,620 --> 0:21:30,880
My hands are stained in blood.

250
0:21:31,560 --> 0:21:33,040
A Joshua indeed.

251
0:21:39,440 --> 0:21:43,560
I've heard that all of your family is in the New World, Colonel.

252
0:21:43,560 --> 0:21:45,760
My mother, my brother, and my sisters.

253
0:21:47,360 --> 0:21:49,840
But not your wife then?

254
0:21:52,160 --> 0:21:55,040
I will have no wife until this quarrel be over.

255
0:21:55,040 --> 0:21:57,280
And how would you settle the quarrel?

256
0:21:59,000 --> 0:22:01,000
By making England a republic.

257
0:22:02,280 --> 0:22:05,920
And if England wants Charles Stuart on his throne again?

258
0:22:05,920 --> 0:22:09,000
Then I will leave England to its King

259
0:22:09,000 --> 0:22:11,040
and go to Massachusetts.

260
0:22:11,240 --> 0:22:13,640
And find me a wife there.

261
0:22:13,640 --> 0:22:16,840
And what shall she be, Colonel?

262
0:22:16,840 --> 0:22:22,320
Such a one as lives and worships in freedom.

263
0:22:22,320 --> 0:22:25,600
One that knows how to truly love a man and be loved.

264
0:22:27,280 --> 0:22:29,760
Oh, and beautiful.

265
0:22:32,640 --> 0:22:34,480
None such in England then?

266
0:22:35,800 --> 0:22:39,880
No, I would not have an English wife, madam.

267
0:22:39,880 --> 0:22:42,680
Not a painted child that knows nothing

268
0:22:42,680 --> 0:22:45,400
but a thousand years of privilege

269
0:22:45,400 --> 0:22:48,800
and calls it "breeding" or "manners".

270
0:22:48,800 --> 0:22:51,000
Calls submission "duty"

271
0:22:51,000 --> 0:22:54,560
and lives only to please a man and pass on his property to his sons.

272
0:22:57,280 --> 0:22:59,120
I will a have a free spirit, madam.

273
0:23:04,240 --> 0:23:06,000
All this and beautiful too.

274
0:23:07,720 --> 0:23:09,720
I fear you will not find this paragon.

275
0:23:10,210 --> 0:23:12,440
I need not find her.

276
0:23:14,040 --> 0:23:15,960
For I believe she will find me.

277
0:23:19,880 --> 0:23:22,080
Will you not speak?

278
0:23:22,080 --> 0:23:26,520
Might you not hear a thousand years of privilege in my voice?

279
0:23:28,680 --> 0:23:30,400
Perhaps a hundred or two.

280
0:23:38,440 --> 0:23:40,240
General Cromwell wishes to see you.

281
0:23:47,860 --> 0:23:49,440
How is dear John?

282
0:23:50,480 --> 0:23:52,040
Well, General, when I saw him.

283
0:23:52,040 --> 0:23:54,680
For a man with rats for bedfellows.

284
0:23:54,680 --> 0:23:56,840
He is there by order of Parliament. I cannot pluck him out.

285
0:23:57,040 --> 0:23:58,760
You plucked me out.

286
0:24:03,280 --> 0:24:06,760
You fought bravely by my side at Kineton and at Marston.

287
0:24:06,760 --> 0:24:08,720
As did Honest John.

288
0:24:08,720 --> 0:24:10,440
And at Naseby thereafter.

289
0:24:10,440 --> 0:24:13,240
Where Charles Stuart lost his throne, did he not?

290
0:24:13,240 --> 0:24:15,400
He lost his power, Edward.

291
0:24:15,600 --> 0:24:17,440
But he is King still

292
0:24:17,440 --> 0:24:20,360
and whoever has him has our destiny in his grip.

293
0:24:21,520 --> 0:24:23,200
The Scotch have sold him to Parliament,

294
0:24:23,200 --> 0:24:25,480
and Parliament have him sitting in Northamptonshire.

295
0:24:25,480 --> 0:24:28,360
And if the army were to seize him,

296
0:24:28,360 --> 0:24:29,960
the army would hold sway.

297
0:24:32,280 --> 0:24:35,560
Then pluck him out of Northamptonshire, General.

298
0:24:35,560 --> 0:24:36,920
That I may not do.

299
0:24:57,970 --> 0:25:00,930
There is a woman in Oxfordshire.

300
0:25:01,960 --> 0:25:05,320
Her true name is not known to God-fearing men.

301
0:25:08,240 --> 0:25:11,520
She is known as the Devil's Whore.

302
0:25:13,490 --> 0:25:17,520
Upon my life, General, this woman is the epitome of wickedness.

303
0:25:19,000 --> 0:25:20,680
Truly, Master Joliffe?

304
0:25:20,680 --> 0:25:24,080
What form does this wickedness take?

305
0:25:25,330 --> 0:25:26,990
Lechery, sir.

306
0:25:28,870 --> 0:25:33,060
She consorts with men.

307
0:25:33,200 --> 0:25:36,440
And what, I pray you, should the army do about that?

308
0:25:36,440 --> 0:25:38,280
She is sent from the devil!

309
0:25:39,320 --> 0:25:40,560
I must confess, sir.

310
0:25:42,080 --> 0:25:43,120
Confess?

311
0:25:46,520 --> 0:25:48,320
Aye, confess.

312
0:25:49,270 --> 0:25:51,230
I don't want to be silent.

313
0:25:51,230 --> 0:25:53,920
Her licentiousness has a purpose, sir.

314
0:25:56,040 --> 0:25:59,280
That purpose is robbery and murder.

315
0:26:02,760 --> 0:26:03,800
She...

316
0:26:03,800 --> 0:26:06,880
uses her...

317
0:26:06,880 --> 0:26:08,080
face...

318
0:26:09,160 --> 0:26:10,520
To trap men.

319
0:26:14,000 --> 0:26:15,160
Well...

320
0:26:16,800 --> 0:26:18,520
Wickedness indeed.

321
0:26:22,640 --> 0:26:27,080
The Parliament require you to make a troop available to me

322
0:26:27,280 --> 0:26:30,600
to search out and take this woman.

323
0:26:33,410 --> 0:26:35,310
My America.

324
0:26:36,900 --> 0:26:38,950
My Newfoundland.

325
0:27:06,950 --> 0:27:09,550
Edward.

326
0:27:11,430 --> 0:27:13,310
Still not dead, then?

327
0:27:14,570 --> 0:27:17,160
No, my Lady, it seems I must live.

328
0:27:17,910 --> 0:27:20,070
I bring a message from the General, sir.

329
0:27:20,070 --> 0:27:21,260
I'll leave you.

330
0:27:21,260 --> 0:27:24,280
No, never. Stay and listen.

331
0:27:29,330 --> 0:27:31,400
He has eyes everywhere.

332
0:27:31,870 --> 0:27:35,430
I believe not a one of us moves his bowels without Oliver senses it.

333
0:27:35,630 --> 0:27:36,540
Craving your pardon, my Lady.

334
0:27:36,540 --> 0:27:37,370
Given.

335
0:27:37,790 --> 0:27:39,860
He wants the King taken and delivered to the Army

336
0:27:39,860 --> 0:27:41,350
but he would not give the order.

337
0:27:42,680 --> 0:27:44,310
Aye.

338
0:27:44,810 --> 0:27:46,450
He would rather I did it.

339
0:27:48,090 --> 0:27:51,050
Whoever does it, risks the wrath of the Parliament.

340
0:27:52,410 --> 0:27:53,650
And yet it should be done.

341
0:27:58,770 --> 0:28:01,290
It shall be done, then.

342
0:28:01,290 --> 0:28:03,530
Think no more on it.

343
0:28:05,530 --> 0:28:08,370
I will risk all in the cause.

344
0:28:12,850 --> 0:28:15,850
Fear not, they will not harm me.

345
0:28:16,050 --> 0:28:19,810
The country would fall to utter ruin without me.

346
0:28:46,820 --> 0:28:48,370
Your business?

347
0:28:48,770 --> 0:28:52,410
Sire. We have come to take you into safe-keeping.

348
0:28:54,050 --> 0:28:58,370
On whose authority do you come to take away a King?

349
0:29:04,370 --> 0:29:06,410
It is a very good authority.

350
0:29:10,330 --> 0:29:13,330
Oliver will never strike him down.

351
0:29:13,330 --> 0:29:16,330
He would not be remembered as the man who threw over the King.

352
0:29:18,970 --> 0:29:19,970
Deep down,

353
0:29:20,670 --> 0:29:24,130
Oliver believes in the good old frame of government.

354
0:29:24,130 --> 0:29:26,220
The cloth that went before cut to a different style?

355
0:29:26,220 --> 0:29:30,850
Authority where it was, rank where it was, land where it was.

356
0:29:31,990 --> 0:29:35,310
And the women sent home again to be silent wives

357
0:29:35,310 --> 0:29:37,350
in harness to their husbands.

358
0:29:37,350 --> 0:29:38,910
In harness to property.

359
0:29:42,840 --> 0:29:45,810
There are two roads to the future, Thomas.

360
0:29:46,360 --> 0:29:49,410
The Leveller regiments will follow yours.

361
0:29:52,230 --> 0:29:53,470
Then what will Oliver do?

362
0:29:55,110 --> 0:29:58,710
And what will Thomas Rainsborough do if the road is blocked?

363
0:29:58,710 --> 0:30:00,590
I will become an American.

364
0:30:01,410 --> 0:30:03,480
Like my wife.

365
0:30:03,820 --> 0:30:06,430
You swore you had no wife, sir.

366
0:30:06,530 --> 0:30:09,060
Oh, I mean to have one.

367
0:30:09,890 --> 0:30:11,410
If she will have me.

368
0:30:15,010 --> 0:30:16,610
Colonel!

369
0:30:19,850 --> 0:30:21,730
Stay.

370
0:30:21,730 --> 0:30:24,410
I will return for my answer.

371
0:30:24,410 --> 0:30:27,650
Colonel, I heard not your question.

372
0:30:31,410 --> 0:30:33,170
Will you be my wife?

373
0:30:33,170 --> 0:30:35,610
Colonel! Parliament men!

374
0:30:39,210 --> 0:30:41,810
Well?

375
0:30:43,510 --> 0:30:47,130
Come and find your answer when duty allows.

376
0:31:00,120 --> 0:31:02,320
This need not concern you, Colonel,

377
0:31:02,570 --> 0:31:04,110
except your garrison will need to know of

378
0:31:04,110 --> 0:31:05,530
our presence in your area.

379
0:31:06,350 --> 0:31:09,720
You bring a troop of horse to seek a woman who stole your purse?

380
0:31:10,230 --> 0:31:13,230
Read further, sir. She murdered my dear friend.

381
0:31:13,230 --> 0:31:15,910
Though, again, sir, it need not concern you.

382
0:31:15,910 --> 0:31:18,620
It concerns me that the Parliament thinks the Army

383
0:31:18,620 --> 0:31:20,630
has no more pressing task to perform

384
0:31:20,630 --> 0:31:23,380
than to indulge the grudges of wealthy men who

385
0:31:23,380 --> 0:31:27,450
stayed at home growing their bellies while others bled to death.

386
0:31:32,030 --> 0:31:33,950
My Lady Angelica Fanshawe.

387
0:31:33,950 --> 0:31:36,550
The mistress of this house.

388
0:31:39,100 --> 0:31:42,710
Ah, my Lady Fanshawe.

389
0:31:42,710 --> 0:31:44,320
Master Joliffe sits in the Parliament

390
0:31:44,320 --> 0:31:46,590
tending the nation's wounds.

391
0:31:46,890 --> 0:31:48,890
He is leaving.

392
0:31:48,890 --> 0:31:51,140
A delight to meet you, madam.

393
0:31:52,180 --> 0:31:56,710
And yet, I swear I have looked upon your face before.

394
0:32:02,090 --> 0:32:04,970
At court, perhaps?

395
0:32:04,970 --> 0:32:07,730
Of course. In the court.

396
0:32:08,870 --> 0:32:11,230
I never could forget such a face.

397
0:32:12,830 --> 0:32:14,670
And I never will.

398
0:32:16,270 --> 0:32:18,110
Farewell, Madam.

399
0:32:20,430 --> 0:32:21,870
Colonel.

400
0:32:29,710 --> 0:32:32,670
Nothing will go well till these leeches are purged.

401
0:32:36,390 --> 0:32:38,030
What was his business?

402
0:32:38,530 --> 0:32:44,250
To persecute some whore. He means to have her hanged.

403
0:32:51,890 --> 0:32:54,370
My answer, Madam?

404
0:33:07,530 --> 0:33:10,250
Do you see him?

405
0:33:10,250 --> 0:33:11,770
See who?

406
0:33:11,770 --> 0:33:13,410
You do not see him?!

407
0:33:16,850 --> 0:33:18,730
I cannot marry you.

408
0:33:19,550 --> 0:33:22,910
There is no future. There is only the past.

409
0:33:40,750 --> 0:33:42,470
Purge of Parliament?

410
0:33:42,470 --> 0:33:46,350
Some thrown out, some kept in.

411
0:33:49,470 --> 0:33:51,390
No, I cannot support it.

412
0:33:51,390 --> 0:33:52,320
They are bloodsuckers.

413
0:33:52,320 --> 0:33:55,830
One sweep of the sword and they are gone. We begin anew.

414
0:33:55,830 --> 0:33:56,830
Ah. A new election?

415
0:33:56,830 --> 0:33:59,610
No. We know who the godly men are,

416
0:33:59,610 --> 0:34:01,230
the men who want the best for England. Let them remain.

417
0:34:01,230 --> 0:34:03,030
No election?

418
0:34:03,030 --> 0:34:04,470
No.

419
0:34:04,470 --> 0:34:05,590
Why no election?

420
0:34:05,590 --> 0:34:08,990
John, the country is half-ruined.

421
0:34:08,990 --> 0:34:10,190
There is famine in the north and west.

422
0:34:10,190 --> 0:34:12,030
Corrupt monopolies flourish.

423
0:34:12,070 --> 0:34:14,230
We must force Parliament to reform.

424
0:34:14,230 --> 0:34:16,630
We need the support of Honest John Lilburne.

425
0:34:16,630 --> 0:34:18,190
In God's name, John,

426
0:34:18,190 --> 0:34:21,350
we want to purge the men whose warrant keeps you rotting here!

427
0:34:21,900 --> 0:34:24,430
Why no election?

428
0:34:24,590 --> 0:34:27,600
Because the country will vote for the King's men!

429
0:34:27,600 --> 0:34:30,510
And you will turn to dust in this rat-infested hole

430
0:34:30,510 --> 0:34:33,330
and your wife and children will starve in a gutter!

431
0:34:34,020 --> 0:34:35,500
But I mistake, of course,

432
0:34:35,500 --> 0:34:37,200
for in truth, there is no more comfortable

433
0:34:37,200 --> 0:34:39,830
place on earth for John Lilburne than a prison cell!

434
0:34:39,830 --> 0:34:42,540
Where he is spared the trouble of considering

435
0:34:42,540 --> 0:34:44,540
the full-grown problems of governance

436
0:34:44,640 --> 0:34:48,470
and not the unborn children of liberty and truth.

437
0:34:48,470 --> 0:34:50,980
Which will lie forever in the womb if we cannot make a world

438
0:34:50,980 --> 0:34:52,900
into which they may be brought!

439
0:34:55,460 --> 0:34:56,460
Comfortable?

440
0:34:57,720 --> 0:35:02,000
Think, John, a purged Parliament

441
0:35:02,000 --> 0:35:05,880
and a law quickly passed by which no man will have an income

442
0:35:06,330 --> 0:35:09,650
above 2,000 a year, not even Earls and Dukes.

443
0:35:09,650 --> 0:35:13,090
By what authority would a law such as that be brought in?

444
0:35:13,090 --> 0:35:14,970
By this authority.

445
0:35:14,970 --> 0:35:17,590
For there is none now else in England, I think you know.

446
0:35:18,120 --> 0:35:20,990
Sir. Within half a day of your departure,

447
0:35:20,990 --> 0:35:22,450
Mistress Fanshawe was arrested.

448
0:35:22,450 --> 0:35:24,840
She's charged with robbery and murder.

449
0:35:27,240 --> 0:35:28,600
They will hang me!

450
0:35:28,600 --> 0:35:30,800
Lies cannot hang you.

451
0:35:30,800 --> 0:35:33,480
This was done to attack me, why else?

452
0:35:36,560 --> 0:35:38,840
Thomas, a word.

453
0:35:44,400 --> 0:35:45,770
You must not tell him.

454
0:35:45,770 --> 0:35:48,060
I killed a thief.

455
0:35:49,690 --> 0:35:51,160
Will he not understand?

456
0:35:51,160 --> 0:35:53,830
No, he will not. He is Thomas Rainsborough,

457
0:35:53,830 --> 0:35:55,020
not Edward Sexby.

458
0:35:56,270 --> 0:35:59,030
Then he will hear me condemned in court.

459
0:36:04,950 --> 0:36:06,790
Elizabeth will stay with you.

460
0:36:08,750 --> 0:36:10,950
Let me pay a visit to Master Joliffe.

461
0:36:10,950 --> 0:36:13,750
Let me ask him in front of his wife and daughter,

462
0:36:13,750 --> 0:36:15,670
how he came to meet this Oxford whore.

463
0:36:15,670 --> 0:36:17,940
Let him tell his lies, Edward, the truth will out.

464
0:36:19,970 --> 0:36:23,820
Angelica, you wanted to speak?

465
0:36:26,890 --> 0:36:28,310
No.

466
0:36:34,510 --> 0:36:38,660
Mistress Fanshawe, the charges against you are as follows -

467
0:36:39,120 --> 0:36:43,420
In the year of our Lord, 1646, you did most cruelly murder

468
0:36:43,420 --> 0:36:45,640
the corn merchant, Master Chimney.

469
0:36:45,640 --> 0:36:49,850
And that with diverse others in Wytham Woods,

470
0:36:49,850 --> 0:36:53,120
you did attack and rob Master Joliffe.

471
0:36:53,120 --> 0:36:58,250
And that you are the notorious felon known as, The Devil's Whore.

472
0:36:59,760 --> 0:37:03,130
What is your answer to these charges?

473
0:37:09,390 --> 0:37:11,380
That I am no whore...

474
0:37:12,710 --> 0:37:14,790
Liar! Whore!

475
0:37:16,020 --> 0:37:18,050
Hang her!        ..And never was!

476
0:37:24,670 --> 0:37:27,390
If your father continues with this case,

477
0:37:27,390 --> 0:37:30,000
your head will follow your hair.

478
0:37:37,230 --> 0:37:40,360
We will proceed to the evidence.

479
0:37:42,430 --> 0:37:44,280
Master Joliffe...

480
0:37:57,660 --> 0:38:01,560
Master Joliffe, will you come forward and give your account?

481
0:38:12,060 --> 0:38:15,770
I...mistook.

482
0:38:16,960 --> 0:38:19,380
This is not the woman who robbed me.

483
0:38:19,900 --> 0:38:24,920
That woman was a whore I used many times in Oxford.

484
0:38:26,680 --> 0:38:32,570
All this I swear...on the blood of Christ.

485
0:38:36,070 --> 0:38:37,310
Release the prisoner.

486
0:38:56,730 --> 0:38:58,580
I ask your forgiveness.

487
0:38:58,580 --> 0:39:01,820
For a while in the prison, a doubt crept into me...

488
0:39:01,820 --> 0:39:03,760
No, Thomas. I killed a man

489
0:39:04,160 --> 0:39:07,480
who wanted my honour for pigeon pie. I was...

490
0:39:09,520 --> 0:39:11,760
There is no past.

491
0:39:11,760 --> 0:39:12,960
Only the future.

492
0:39:17,240 --> 0:39:19,760
There is something more I must tell you.

493
0:39:26,440 --> 0:39:28,680
I am with child.

494
0:39:37,880 --> 0:39:40,600
A speedy settlement.

495
0:39:40,600 --> 0:39:43,640
I will bring forward new proposals to the Parliament soon.

496
0:39:45,280 --> 0:39:50,560
Your Majesty, my heart is filled with joy to hear that promise.

497
0:39:50,560 --> 0:39:53,070
But I must tell His Majesty

498
0:39:53,070 --> 0:39:55,920
from the love that I bear Your Majesty,

499
0:39:55,920 --> 0:39:59,400
and ever will, there are some in the army that are put to worry

500
0:39:59,400 --> 0:40:01,520
by the many rumours that His Majesty

501
0:40:01,520 --> 0:40:04,800
yet seeks an intervention from the Scottish force.

502
0:40:04,800 --> 0:40:06,360
No, no, no, no.

503
0:40:07,880 --> 0:40:09,000
No.

504
0:40:11,080 --> 0:40:14,600
And that is also a promise from His Majesty?

505
0:40:16,280 --> 0:40:18,800
Of course it is a promise.

506
0:40:27,200 --> 0:40:29,880
Thomas Rainsborough.

507
0:40:29,880 --> 0:40:31,960
What of him, Majesty?

508
0:40:33,560 --> 0:40:36,000
He is a fanatical.

509
0:40:36,000 --> 0:40:37,440
A Leveller.

510
0:40:39,200 --> 0:40:42,640
Should such a man be in such high command?

511
0:40:44,280 --> 0:40:46,410
I would sleep easier in my bed

512
0:40:46,410 --> 0:40:48,500
if he were removed from our affairs.

513
0:40:50,320 --> 0:40:52,680
Thomas is the best man in England, sire.

514
0:40:55,040 --> 0:40:56,520
And my friend.

515
0:40:58,160 --> 0:41:00,920
Well, then let any man here tell me a better way.

516
0:41:00,920 --> 0:41:04,560
Let any man here tell me any other way

517
0:41:04,560 --> 0:41:04,560
this ship can be brought into harbour

518
0:41:04,560 --> 0:41:06,560
other than to talk to Charles Stuart?

519
0:41:06,560 --> 0:41:11,080
He game me solemn undertakings. Promises from his own lips.

520
0:41:11,080 --> 0:41:12,700
Which will prove false as ever before.

521
0:41:12,700 --> 0:41:13,920
Gentlemen.

522
0:41:13,920 --> 0:41:17,240
We have Royalist uprisings in south Wales,

523
0:41:17,240 --> 0:41:18,240
in Yorkshire and in Cheshire.

524
0:41:18,240 --> 0:41:19,640
Then let us crush them!

525
0:41:19,640 --> 0:41:23,200
Aye Thomas, we can crush them.

526
0:41:23,200 --> 0:41:27,000
We can spend our lifetimes, and our children's,

527
0:41:27,000 --> 0:41:27,000
killing and killing again.

528
0:41:27,000 --> 0:41:30,360
But when the killing stops, where is England?

529
0:41:30,360 --> 0:41:33,560
We cannot achieve all, my friends,

530
0:41:33,560 --> 0:41:37,160
but we can achieve... a sufficiency!

531
0:41:37,160 --> 0:41:39,720
A sufficiency of Charles Stuart?

532
0:41:39,720 --> 0:41:42,840
A sufficiency of bloated thieves in the Parliament?

533
0:41:42,840 --> 0:41:46,320
A sufficiency of soldiers who fought for their country,

534
0:41:46,320 --> 0:41:49,640
only to be told they must now starve for the wages promised.

535
0:41:51,320 --> 0:41:53,400
I fought not for that sufficiency!

536
0:41:53,400 --> 0:41:54,520
Hear, hear!

537
0:41:54,520 --> 0:41:57,880
Well, what then, Thomas? More death, more destruction, what?

538
0:42:01,320 --> 0:42:03,880
We exile Charles Stuart.

539
0:42:07,520 --> 0:42:09,080
Let him depart.

540
0:42:09,080 --> 0:42:12,640
Let us govern the country through councils elected in the streets

541
0:42:12,640 --> 0:42:14,160
the guilds, the universities.

542
0:42:14,160 --> 0:42:16,240
Elected in the streets? By whom?

543
0:42:16,240 --> 0:42:18,400
By all men.

544
0:42:18,400 --> 0:42:21,400
For I think the poorest he that is in England

545
0:42:21,400 --> 0:42:23,400
has a life to live is the greatest he.

546
0:42:25,040 --> 0:42:27,880
No more Parliaments for men with property only.

547
0:42:27,880 --> 0:42:29,520
We should burn it down.

548
0:42:32,280 --> 0:42:33,640
Well, then, Thomas...

549
0:42:35,320 --> 0:42:38,920
..and all of you, my friends and comrades,

550
0:42:38,920 --> 0:42:41,320
I must tell you this.

551
0:42:41,320 --> 0:42:44,360
What Colonel Rainsborough urges this council to accept

552
0:42:44,360 --> 0:42:47,360
is a form of government unknown on this Earth,

553
0:42:47,360 --> 0:42:51,200
and one that will straightway fall into anarchy.

554
0:42:51,200 --> 0:42:54,880
Rather than let this beloved England fall into such misery,

555
0:42:54,880 --> 0:42:56,120
I tell you now,

556
0:42:57,150 --> 0:43:00,080
I would pull promises out of Charles Stuart's mouth

557
0:43:00,080 --> 0:43:01,800
another thousand years.

558
0:43:04,320 --> 0:43:06,160
Then it's clear, General.

559
0:43:06,160 --> 0:43:08,840
In this beloved England, one of us will not live.

560
0:43:15,560 --> 0:43:19,760
If you rise up, you will be called mutineers and traitors.

561
0:43:19,760 --> 0:43:21,680
Oliver is still the hero.

562
0:43:21,680 --> 0:43:25,520
Then the regiments must be prepared for this convulsion.

563
0:43:25,520 --> 0:43:28,080
Reason says we lose all in delay.

564
0:43:29,960 --> 0:43:33,160
Now tell me what your heart says, Edward.

565
0:43:33,970 --> 0:43:36,410
I have butchered men.

566
0:43:37,560 --> 0:43:39,320
Here and in Germany.

567
0:43:40,920 --> 0:43:43,080
But say the word, Colonel,

568
0:43:43,080 --> 0:43:45,720
and I will sharpen my blades once again.

569
0:43:45,720 --> 0:43:50,000
This time for justice, not for pay.

570
0:43:56,260 --> 0:44:01,090
Edward Sexby has nothing to lose on this Earth.

571
0:44:01,800 --> 0:44:03,840
Others have.

572
0:44:06,070 --> 0:44:07,720
Madam?

573
0:44:07,720 --> 0:44:11,580
One man only may unite the Army

574
0:44:11,580 --> 0:44:13,290
in this great matter, Thomas.

575
0:44:14,860 --> 0:44:16,710
That man is you.

576
0:44:27,840 --> 0:44:29,860
Thomas.

577
0:44:31,280 --> 0:44:33,920
Charles Stuart has broken his promises.

578
0:44:33,920 --> 0:44:35,680
Every one of them.

579
0:44:35,680 --> 0:44:37,800
By escaping from Hampton Court.

580
0:44:37,800 --> 0:44:40,200
Gone, it is thought, to the Island of Wight.

581
0:44:42,320 --> 0:44:47,680
I come to apologise to you...and to all.

582
0:44:49,080 --> 0:44:53,120
For that I was foolishly dazzled by him.

583
0:44:53,120 --> 0:44:55,930
We will negotiate with this false man no more.

584
0:44:56,480 --> 0:44:59,120
But, Thomas,

585
0:44:59,120 --> 0:45:01,630
there must now be unity amongst us

586
0:45:01,630 --> 0:45:04,070
or all will be brought to ruin.

587
0:45:04,070 --> 0:45:06,410
There are new uprisings today in Essex

588
0:45:06,410 --> 0:45:08,450
and in Yorkshire and in Cheshire and in Wales

589
0:45:08,450 --> 0:45:10,190
and in Bristol, too.

590
0:45:10,230 --> 0:45:13,280
The country needs its Army now as never before.

591
0:45:15,120 --> 0:45:17,240
What say you?

592
0:45:21,880 --> 0:45:23,560
When we have done,

593
0:45:23,560 --> 0:45:26,170
will all matters as to how we govern this country

594
0:45:26,170 --> 0:45:27,560
be for discussion?

595
0:45:29,620 --> 0:45:30,710
All matters.

596
0:45:30,710 --> 0:45:35,210
And will all matters as to land and property be for discussion?

597
0:45:38,040 --> 0:45:39,880
All.

598
0:45:49,280 --> 0:45:51,520
You are needed in Pontefract, Thomas.

599
0:45:51,520 --> 0:45:53,840
A siege such as only you can lift.

600
0:45:53,840 --> 0:45:55,280
But I beg of you, make speed.

601
0:45:55,280 --> 0:45:56,990
Our enemies were making ready for this

602
0:45:56,990 --> 0:45:59,640
while I blinked in the sunlight of the king's gaze.

603
0:45:59,670 --> 0:46:01,120
I will go tomorrow.

604
0:46:01,120 --> 0:46:02,060
Tonight, Thomas.

605
0:46:02,060 --> 0:46:04,560
Tonight must be my wedding night, Oliver.

606
0:46:05,520 --> 0:46:08,840
If my lady will marry a soldier that will be gone in the morning?

607
0:46:08,840 --> 0:46:10,040
She will.

608
0:46:10,750 --> 0:46:13,250
May God grant you a long life together.

609
0:46:13,760 --> 0:46:17,590
I must go to Wales, a thing I never thought to do.

610
0:46:17,590 --> 0:46:18,740
Fare you well.

611
0:46:18,740 --> 0:46:20,960
Will you not offer me a wedding gift, General?

612
0:46:23,320 --> 0:46:25,080
If it can be done.

613
0:46:25,080 --> 0:46:27,210
Let John Lilburne go free.

614
0:46:27,210 --> 0:46:29,000
Overthrow Parliament's warrant.

615
0:46:31,640 --> 0:46:33,420
It is done, madam.

616
0:46:33,420 --> 0:46:36,160
By authority of the Army.

617
0:46:43,040 --> 0:46:45,720
You will not make me a wife for one night, I hope?

618
0:47:02,920 --> 0:47:04,640
I must disappoint you, Edward.

619
0:47:04,640 --> 0:47:06,090
No fight for you.

620
0:47:07,000 --> 0:47:09,830
Till I return, guard this woman with your life.

621
0:47:17,920 --> 0:47:21,000
Why do you sleep on straw still, Sexby?

622
0:47:32,200 --> 0:47:35,680
I wish you were by Thomas' side in Yorkshire.

623
0:47:39,520 --> 0:47:40,960
I wish it, too.

624
0:47:43,520 --> 0:47:46,520
He is the best man I ever met.

625
0:47:53,120 --> 0:47:57,720
Sexby, do you ever think of those times in Wytham Woods?

626
0:48:01,720 --> 0:48:04,200
I have never been in Wytham Woods, my lady.

627
0:48:08,880 --> 0:48:10,960
Except once.

628
0:48:12,120 --> 0:48:14,200
To swim one day when I was hot.

629
0:48:24,880 --> 0:48:27,520
We come with a message from General Cromwell.

630
0:48:30,130 --> 0:48:32,160
When you were the god of battles,

631
0:48:32,160 --> 0:48:34,120
there was ever a sign of your blessing on me.

632
0:48:35,760 --> 0:48:38,880
Now when you rest upon my shoulders, my sight is dim.

633
0:48:40,520 --> 0:48:42,320
I think I see the road...

634
0:48:43,920 --> 0:48:46,040
..and yet I fear to tread it.

635
0:48:48,160 --> 0:48:50,800
I know the man I must strike down

636
0:48:50,800 --> 0:48:54,360
and yet I fear the blood that will be shed thereafter.

637
0:49:38,440 --> 0:49:40,160
The fight...

638
0:49:54,080 --> 0:49:57,720
Take men to the Island and arrest Charles Stuart.

639
0:49:57,720 --> 0:50:01,440
He will be charged with making unlawful war on England.

640
0:50:01,440 --> 0:50:03,960
Let others stand ready to enter the Parliament.

641
0:50:07,320 --> 0:50:08,480
The time has come.

642
0:50:25,160 --> 0:50:27,080
Husband.

643
0:50:27,630 --> 0:50:28,970
Yes?

644
0:50:33,760 --> 0:50:36,120
There will be a life for us, will there not?

645
0:50:38,560 --> 0:50:40,840
One day the argument will be over.

646
0:50:43,640 --> 0:50:45,320
There is a life to come.

647
0:51:05,720 --> 0:51:07,720
Arrest her.

648
0:51:07,720 --> 0:51:09,240
You shall not touch her!

649
0:51:09,240 --> 0:51:11,200
Sexby, desist.

650
0:51:12,840 --> 0:51:15,510
What does it matter now? Let them hang me.
