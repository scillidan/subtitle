一个女人把目己的身体让渡给了她的孩子

A woman abandons her body to her children,

246
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:51,060
由他们所吞噬 这惑是我们必须反抗的

she is devoured by them and this is what we must rebel against.

247
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,060
如果无法控制目己身体的话

No woman can define herself as free,，

248
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,630
没有任何一个女人 可以定义自己为自由身

并 she does not have control over her own body.

249
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,960
这是我们必须解决的问题

Thats the issue we must tackle.

250
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,830
我们谈论各种各样的事情

We say this applying it to everything，

251
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,790
但我们从未谈及母性

but we never apply it to motherhood.

252
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,990
而且我非音幸运地 在家邀请到了埃茉娜`格雷科

256
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,760
她说没有人认为  和母邓

who says no one thinks a mother has a woman's body.

257
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,530
对于子女而言 母亲的身体是变化无形的

For sons and daughters mothers have amorphous bodies.

258
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,490
我们也这么认为

Wethought that too,

259
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,260
也许我们会想到我们的母杀

and maybe we still think it about our mothers.

260
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,690
我们应该感到羞愧

We should be ashamed .

261
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,590
我的女儿们也在场 融在这

Then there are my daughters here they are.

262
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,490
可能她们也会这样想

Maybe they also think like that,

00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,190
(梅尼乌斯'阿格里由 元言故事人物 证罗马贵族 闭名护教者)
但梅尼乌斯.阿格里由其昭了他们

But Menenius Agrippa tricks them.

304
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,630
稍等 我举个例子

Listen.

305
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,090
艾尔水吧了东西 难道你融不饭了吗 不是的

上fElsa eats, does your hunger go away?

306
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,790
并不会 平民也是如此

No and neither does the common people's,

307
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,460
他们的秀动最后被贵族吞噬了

because their work ends up in the patricians'stomachs.

308
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,160
对不外 我在出版社耽摘了一会儿

Sorry, 1 was held up at the publishers .

309
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,590
玛丽娅罗水呢 她一会儿回来 带着一个惊喜

And Mariarosay? She'l be home later with a surprise.

310
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,630

311
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,860
一会儿残知道了

我票坏了

|'m shattered .

313
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,660
你们在学习吗

Are you studying?

314
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,490
我在复习寓言故事 一篇思权的文章

Im reviewing the "Apologue,"garbage.

315
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,490
为什么这么说 他说的 弗兰科

316
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,560
妈妈 这文章说我吃东西 但胖的却是你

她们本有可能是我们俩的孩子

They could have been ours.

322
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,560
如果是的话 年龄会大一些

They'd be a bit older now.

323
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,990

我们想什么时候睡咒都可以 什么意思

334
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,030
也不是一直 别太夸张了

Not always, let's not exaggerate.

335
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,890
那你们早上和皇么起得来 我们什么时候起融什么时候学习

So its true you don't go to school. They study here.

337
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,090
有一次警察也来了

Policemen came too.

338
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,260
警察来过这里吗 对 就在这

The police were herey? Yes, right here.

339
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,190
多和莉娅娜生么样

她们在这儿生么学习 我们辅导她们

How do they study here? We help them.

342
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,960
这是暂时的 如果她们留下来 我们可以安排

Its temporary, ifthey stay.…

343
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,590
暂时的

ts temporary.

344
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,890
暂时的标准是什么

And what's the criterion for "temporary"”?

345
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,160
你们融是这样生活的吗

ls this how you and my sister live?

346
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,030
我他妈爱怎么生活都可以

live howthe fuck | want.

347
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,060
至于她们 既没有不开心 也没有变磊

As for them, they seem neither unhappy nor ignorant，

348
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,300
而且我们一直在教她们

and one of us always helps them.

349
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,960
你们俩教吗 在这儿的任何人都可以

One of you? Whoever's here.

350
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,430
任何人

Whoever's here.

351
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,260
你们两个太不负责任了 你意识到了吗

You're Dotps So irresponsible.

352
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,990
你把她们从一个有纪律的家中市走

You took them away from a home where there was discipline,

353
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,830
把她们变成了流溪汉

and turned them into hobosl

354
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,290
你想做什么 你想带走她们吗

Do you want to take them away?

355
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,430
你和多莉娅娜来抚养她们吗 你认为我没有能力吗

You and Dorian a will raise them? You think 1m not capable?

356
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,030
你党得
What do you 号呢

357
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,860
你觉得她们能这样暂时地生活吗

They cant live in a "temporary"situation,

358
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,860
能随便和任何人学习吗 她们可以像其他孩子一样去上学

study with whoever's there not go to school like other kidsl

359
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,160
冷静一下 彼得罗

Calm down.

360
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:11,160
恕我插嘴 但我也偶尔辅导她们学习

Excuse me for butting in but 1 also help them study.

361
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,430
没错 她们跟来这儿的人学习 我也偶尔参与其中

Sure, they study with whoevers there and when they're lucky it's you.

362
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,160
她们俩很聪明 而且她们在尽可能地学习

The girls are clevenr they study as much as necessary,

363
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,260
她们的理解能力很强

their level of learning is very high.

364
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,390
她们需要规律的生活

They need a regular life.

365
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,360
你的文儿需要什么 不由我来癌

| dont have to tell you what your daughters need.

366
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,690
的确 我来告诉你 告诉你们所有人

In fact, Ttell you. All of you.

367
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,260
她们需要万法 需要标准化

They need method, a criterion.

368
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,390
这个家里有很多人

This house is full of people,

369
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,030
在这儿人们会演奏 讨论

who play music who discuss things.

370
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,430
我认为我也不喜欢 我总是把目己关在房间

1dont like it either hm always shut away in my room.

371
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,890
但这也是一个标准化的事情

But that's also a criterion ，

372
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,360
只不过是暂时的

definitely temporary.

373
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,360
埃莱娜和孩子们都不会符太入

Neither Elena nor the girls will stay here for long.

374
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,490
但是我训实话 等她们长大后

But when they're grown Up，

375
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:04,590
在这儿的日子 会是她们最美好的回忆之一

among their best memories will be the days spent here,

376
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,160
在玛丽并罗水家的日子

at MariaroSsa'S.

377
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,490
或许的确如此

That's probably right,

378
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,060
我对此并不感到遗憾

and | cant be sorry about 雍

379
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,660
但我们必须拉心目问

but the question we have to ask is,

380
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,660
她们能回归正常的生活吗

willthey be able to go back to a regular life?

381
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,360
如果大人都做不到 何况她们呢

ff adults struggle to do it imagine them.

382
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,360
在你父母那里 她们有一个家

At your parents' they had a family，

383
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,660
但在这里 她们也有

but they have one here too.

384
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,560
并且在这里 她们更快乐

And its more fun for them.

385
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,860
弗三科 你并没有回答我的问题

You didnt answer my question.

386
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,990
她们会被强迫适应 会反击 但最后会届服

They'l be forced, they'fight back but then they'l give in.

387
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,230
我很抱歉

Forgive me.

388
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,630
只是太担心你们 我希邓你们得到世界上最好的

But lm worried about you, 1 only want what's best for you.

389
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,390
你们妈妈和我在这一点上 无疑达成了共识

Your mother and | agree on this.

390
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,860
是的 是这样

YeS, its true.

391
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,090
波得罗是对的

Pietro was right.

392
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,790
对我女儿来说 正确的选择

What was right for my daughters,

393
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,030
并不是我之前说服自己的那样

was not what 1d convinced myself it was.

394
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,490
她们的确应该与别人相处

They needed to be with others,

395
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,090
需要日程安排 家庭作业 还有同伴

to have Schedules homework, classmates.

396
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,960
我可以跟你回家去吗

Can lcome home with you?

397
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,790
别任性

Dont act up.

398
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,790
至少你要陪我进去吧

Wilyou take me inside?

399
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,690
杀爱的 如今已经两个多礼拜了

Its been more than two weeks now，

400
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,830
老师都况你应该更独立一些

the teacher said you need to be more independent.

401
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,560
去吧 我会看着你的

402
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,560

403
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,010


404
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,890
我看着呢 去吧

Im watching, go.

405
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,460
那些白子我都在鄙视目己

| spent those days despising myself.

406
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,060
我无法将尼话从脑海中抹去

| couldn't get Nino out of my head.

我将近三个月没有见他

我目己也承认 我非常想他

我一直都很想他

|thought of him all the time.

410
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,460
甚至城市的每个街道都让我想象

Even the city streets made me imagine,

411
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:51,790
我和他一起走在这里 会是什么样子

what ii would be like 1walked them with him，

412
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,660
送完孩子 我们一起回家会是什么样

并we came back from the School together after dropping off the girls.

413
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,390
你怎么在这儿

What are you doing here?

414
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,690
我昨晚从那不勒斯出友的

结果会如何呢

And what would the result be?

421
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,260
会永远没法安子地和你生活

That 1 could never live peacefully with you.

422
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,230
尔得听我说 莱农

You have to listen to_ me.

但没有你 我根本无法生活

428
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,390
那我的理解没有错

429
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:05,090
你给我的提议是

you're suggesting as a reasonable solution,，

430
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,060
让我改变情人的身份 做你的第二个妻子

that 1 give up the role of mistress to be a parallel wifel

你想知道我为什么这样做吗

You want to know why | behaved like that?

438
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,590
因为埃利奥诺拉已经怀孕七个月了

Eleonora is seven months pregnant.

439
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,690
所以现在我很难离开她

That's why it's so hard to leave her now.

440
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,190


441

弗明科 把他赶走

感到被迫做这件事 是没有意义的

妈妈 这个贴在弗朗科的房间外

This was outside Franco's room.

528
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,060

00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,230
你们最近老是打扰他吗

埃莱娜 不要让两个孩子进来

"Elena, dont let the girls in."

533
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,790


534
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,990
就像唱歌一样

The same as the song.

535
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,360
我们必须歌唱

That we have to sing.

536
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,990
圭子破旧不卉

Worn-out shoes.

537
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:11,060
但我们必须继续前行

And yet we must march on.

538
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,390


539
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:43,490


540
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,760


541
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,260
玛丽娅罗沙

MariaroSsa_.

542
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,830
西尔维亚

Silvia.

543
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,160


544
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,990
尼诡

Nino?

545
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:55,890
尼诡

Nino?

546
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,030
为什么

Why?

547
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,090
我原本想等一等再离开

1d have preferred to wait before leaving，

548
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:17,460
留在玛丽娅罗沙身边

stay close to Mariarosal

549
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:21,160
但她对我不再是那种姐妹的态度

but she no longer treated me in a sisterly manner，

550
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,630
而是越来越序满政意

and she became increasingly hostile.

551
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:28,690
如果两个孩子在家里玩的时候弄出声吗 她会非营生气

She got angry ifthe girls made noise playing,

552
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,960
如果我贡驾她们 她会更生气

she got even angrier if1scolded them for their noisy games，

553
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,890
所以我收拾了行李 返回那不勒斯

so | packed our bags and went back to Naples.

554
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:41,690
当我们重新开始相爱的时候 埃莉奥诺拉还怀着身孕

Eleonora was still pregnant when we began to love each other again.

555
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,460
当她生下一个叫莉迪亚的女孩时

And by the time she gave birth to a girl named Lidia.

556
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:50,960
尼诺和我早已恢复成一对正芝的情人

Nino and | had already returned to being a couple of lovers,

557
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,860
有着我们目己的生活

with our habits，

558
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:57,030
漂有的房子 两个孩子

a beautiful house, two girls,

559
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,590
还有非单丰富的生活

and a rather jntense |ife.

560
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:05,490
但是我和我的女儿们 在那不勒斯做什么呢

But what were my daughters and 1 doing in Naples?

561
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,030
我们只是为了让尼诺高兴吗

We were there only to make Nino happy.

562
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,790
我做出一副目由独立的样子 我是在说详吧

| was lying when | acted free and autonomous,

563
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:18,590
我在欺骗我的听众 尽管我说了那么多

and |was lying to my audience despite all my talk

564
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:22,660
但我还是让一个男人捏造我 好满足他的需

Since | had let a man control me to the point where his needs,

565
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:26,030
高于我和两个女儿的需:

prevailed over mine and my daughters'.

566
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,230
从佩特拉卡大街看过去 城区很远 融像一个苑昌的石头堆

From Via Petrarca, the neighborhood was a pale, distant memory.

567
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,760
我可以反复告诉目己 我现在成了另一个人

1 could tell myself 1 was someone else now,

568
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,060
这里和我再也没有任何瓜葛了 但事实并非如此

and | had nothing to do with it anymore, but that wasn't the case.

569
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,230
我还是在不断地出现在这里

| kept showing up to see it.

570
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,090
我知道我已经没有借口逃避了

| knew | was out of excuses，

571
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,860
是时候去直面它了

iLwWastime | dealt with 汪
