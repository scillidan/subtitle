丙泰尔的出版社想在巴黎再办一些推介会

但他们束好像生活在一个平行世界里

我有好几天没听到她们的消息了

但纵使这多么难以忍受

But as unbearable as it was，

我不能拒绝那两位女编辑的邀请

我推迟几天回家 也不会改变什么

那个周五 我没有去接女儿们

阿售尔一点都不惊订

我意识到我的效婆提出了一个真正的问题

和尼诺在一起时 我想见她们

我们想出面参与 观察 研究

00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,720
警察无情的鸣笛 检查站

The wailing police sirens, the roadblocks,

266
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,890
直升机螺旋桨的呼啸户 被红色旅杀害的人

267
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,330
都是我们在一起的时间线上的标坊

几个星期 几个月

Weeks months，

269
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,370
第一年 伏后是一年半

ayear and then ayear and a half

270
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,540
这一切的一切 都是从佛罗伦萨的那个夜里

every public event took on meaning only from that night

271
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,440
我进到尼诡的房间 开始算起

at my house in Florence when |joined Nino in his room.

272
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,880
我们襄从那时候起 生活才刚刚开始

That was when, we told each other our true life had begun.

273
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,150
我们称之为真正的生活

And what we called true life

274
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,360
即使每天面对可怕的场景

was that sense of miraculous splendor that never left us

275
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,990
那种神奇的感觉也没有散去

not even when everyday horrors played out around us.

276
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:04,200
早上好 基督教民主兑的领字 莫罗

Moro, leader of the Christian Democratic party

277
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,040
今早9点10分遭遇恐怖分子绑织

was kidnapped this morning by a squad of terrorists.…

278
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,870
各位同僚 我认为正是在这样的赤剧时刻

Colleagues, precisely in this dramatic moment,

279
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,880
我们必须理智地诚实地提醒自己

we must have the intellectual honesty to remind ourselves

280
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,120
那个给国家抹黑

that the one who threw mud on the state，

281
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,620
暴露出国家最糟糕一面的人

Who revealed its worst face，

282
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:27,560
那个为红色旅诞生创造了条件的人

and who also created the conditions for the birth of the Red Brigades.

283
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,590
考虑到他目前所处的情况 我很抱歉这么襄

|m sorry to Say this given the Situation he's in，

284
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,130
但那个人恰恰融是莫罗

but 由was Morao

285
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:37,400
他蔡腐败的政党 隐满那些令人不安的真相

Concealing uncomfortable truths for his corrupt party.

286
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,500
甚至把目己的政党 等同于国家

Indeed, identifying the party with the state itself

287
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,740
你在说什么 意思是 这一切是莫罗各由目取吗

What are you Saying, that Moro's guilty?

288
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,910
打住 别评陷我 说我没说过的话

No, don't make me say things 1 didn't say.

289
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,980
我是况 我们必须持卫国家机构

1 Say we must defend the institutions

290
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:55,450
但择卫并不意味着掩善他们的罪行 而是使一切公开透明

not by hiding their misdeeds, but by making them transparent，

291
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,090
不回避任何事情

With no omissions.

292
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,550
你是站哪边的

What side are you on?

293
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,590
我一定要选边站吗 那我站我的理智这边 可以吗

Im on the side of my head.

294
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,560
不好意思 现在不是讨论这些的时间

This isntthetime for discussions of this kind.

295
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,730
那残别开会了

Then let's not hold conferences

296
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,100
因为总会有其他更紧急的事

because there'l always be another emergency.

297
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:13,270
只有莫罗理解我们这个时代的解放进程

Only Moro has understood the processes of liberation of our time.

298
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,300
他认可青年和女性运动的力量

He recognized the strength of the youth and feminist movements，

299
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,370
而那些左派则任由我们目生目次

300

没有的事 我认同你的说法

Not at all, | agree with you.

302
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,050
您对这样一个处于生命危险中的人 曼无同情 真是可下

You're being CH about a man whose life is in dangernl

303
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,220
不 我比你更同情他

No, | have more pity than you.

304
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:37,630
同情意味着看到现实 然后去感类它

Pietas means to see reality and then to sense it.

305
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,100
我可以走 没问题

1 can leave, no problem.

306
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,470
你霸么敢说这种话

How dare you Say these thingSs?

307
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:53,440
你两个月前说了同样的话

You were Saying 月 Same things two months ago.

308

你搞错了 那不是我

You're mistaken, that wasnt me.

309
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,350
你摘混了 你记性太差了

You're getting it mixed up! You have a short memory.

310
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,420
继续你们的研讨会吧

Go ahead with your conference.

311
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:14,100
但请别张嘴闭嘴 融是萨尔维米尼

312
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,660
先去读读他的书吧

Read him first.

313
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,510
无聊得要死 伪善小人的聚会

Deadly boring, the festival of hypocrisy!

314
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,550
你是站哪边的   有意 意思吧

"What side are you on?" Did you like it?

315
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,450
只有我们最重要

Only we mattered

316
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,790
只要我们俩是一心的残够了

and every time it converged back to the two of us.

317
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,120
假如我们在一起 融没有任何批评能伤害到我们

上 we were together no criticism could touch us.

318
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,690
我们反倒会变得很骄做

On the contrary we became conceited，

319
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,800
我们的观点是最重要的 其他事情都没有意义

nothing made sense except our opinions.

320
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,730
我们一起去吃饭 享受美食 红酒和性爱

Weranto dinners, to good food, to wine', to sex.

321
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,070
我们只想紧紧拥抱在一起

All we wanted was to hold each other cling to each other

322
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,010
我有一件事要告诉你

| have something to tell you.

323
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,750
看你脸色应该挺严肃的

From the look on your face it seems serious.

324
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:10,350
这是我这奉子做过的最着耻的一件事

Its perhaps the most shameful thing lve ever done in my life.

325
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:17,960

关于你和军教老师友生冲突的事情 你记得

The story about the clash with the religion teacher.

330
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,570
你做了什么

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,880
当时读的时候

00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,620
我党得那篇文章看起来很舒服 而且殉满智慧

| couldn't believe someone could write in a way

333
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,950
我总得不可思议

that was So pleasing and intelligent.

334
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,790
我改了很多次

| rewrote it so many times.

335
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:55,460
我长至去找了莉拉 让她帮有我修改

| even asked Lila to read it and help me.

336
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,070
我想在你面前好好表现一下

| wanted to impress you.

337
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,910
后来他们没有友表那篇文章 我还很伤心呢

| was upset that they didn't publish it

338
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,410
我当时跟你说 是因为版面不够了 对吗

| told you it was for lack of space, right?

339
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,280
是的

Yes, |think So.

340
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,520
事实上 当时有足够的版面友表你那篇文章

The truth is there was plenty of space.

341
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,690
那他们为什么不出版它

Then why didn'tthey publish it?

342
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,860
出于嫉妨

Out of envy.

343
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,030
那些编辑立妒我吗

The editors were envious of me?

344
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,400
是我人妨你

| was the one who was enviousS.

345
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,100
我看了你的文章 然后把它们扔进了垃圾桶

read your pages and lthrew them in the garbage,

346
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,270
没法容忍你写得那么好

| couldn't bear that you were So good.

347
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:44,010
他没有必要告诉我那件事

There was no need to tell me about that episode,

348
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,780
但他说了

and yet he did.

349
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:51,120
他对真诚的重视 超越了任何利益考量 这让我很感动

His need to be sincere beyond any bene代 moved me.

350
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,660

00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,870
你知道目己在说什么吗

Do you realize what you're Saying?

452
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,340
那是一个充满暴力 混乱的城市

Its a violent disorderly city，

453
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,540
你们总是很过分

you are always SO exCessive.

454
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,780
你们 是指谁

"You"? Who are you talking about?

455
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,350
你 你们

About you, about all of you.

00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,820
你再出行时 要把女儿们留给你妈妈吗

Wilyou leave Dede and Elsa with your mother when you travel?

459
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,690
我想留给谁残留给谁 我不同意

川leave them with whoever1want. No wayl

460
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,630
我不允许入得和艾尔沙

| dont want Dede and Elsa to come into contact

461
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,630
和一些失控的人一起生活

with people who are out of control.

462
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:02,780
我曾以为 你是我一直很需要的那种妈妈

1thought you were the mother figure 1d always needed.

463
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,250
但我错了

| was wrong.

464
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,220
我妈妈比你好多了

My mother is better than you.

465
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,830
埃茉娜

Elena_.

466
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,000
你想先洗个澡吗

圭多回来 我们一起吃个饭

00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,040
也好

469
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,740
我给你准备好了客房

1 prepared the guest room for you.

470
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,510
我和我女儿一起睡

1 sleep with the girls.

471
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:51,460
你的一个朋友打过很多次电话

Afriend of yours has been calling.

472
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,900
她为什么打到这来

Why did she call here?

473
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,000
可能她知道你偶尔会来

Maybe she knows you drop in every now and then.

474
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,440
者拉来电 081 226942

478
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,830
把这片放那里吧

479
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,550
把这个一并放在那

480
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,790

487
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,240


488

00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,450

还有谁姓艾罗塔呢

493
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,930

还有了呢

And then?

495
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,660


496
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,730
妈妈叫什么名字

And whats Mamma's name?

497
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,570
埃莱娜.格雷科

Elena Grecao.

498
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,640

499
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,740
义罗塔

500
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,080

501
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,420
晚安 至贝们

Goodnight my dears.

502
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,230
你和尼诺:萨拉托雷 最近怎么样

How's it going with Nino 0

503
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,440
这样做值得吗

Was itworth it?

504
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:18,140
他是个聪明的男人 明白目身目标所在

He's an intelligent man, he knows his stuff

505
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,210
但他不太稳定

but he's erratic

506
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,480
我不喜欢他最近写的那些东西

1dont like the things he's written recently.

507
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,380
毕竟找到目身的定位是一件很难的事

After all, its hard to find one's way

508
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,520
在意大利当前的危机混乱之中

amid the chaos of the crisis in ltaly,

509
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,120
尤其是像他那样野心勃勃的男人

especially for men like him who want to do things.

510
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,060
我得去加会儿班

Im going to work a bit.

511
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,430
但是每个人有不同的做法

But there's doing and doing.

512
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:50,410
院拉托雷的取明是没有根基的

Sarratore is an intelligence without traditions,

513
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,780
他喜欢取悦擎权者

he'd rather make a good impression on the powers that be

514
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,780
而不是为某种理想而理斗

than stand up for an idea.

515
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,190
诡的聪明是没有根基的 是什么意思

加让 does "Nino's an intelligence without traditions" mean?

516
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,990
他谁都不是

That he's a nobody.

517
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,490
对于一个谁也不是的人 渴届成为

And for people like that, becoming someone

518
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,100
这对他比任何事情都重要

is more important than anything else.

519
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:18,630
导致的结果是 萨拉托雷先生会是一个不可靠的人

Consequently Mr. Sarratore is unreliable.

520
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,770
我的职明也是没有根基的

Im also an intelligence without traditions.

521
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,310
你也是 所以的确

Yes, and in fact..

522
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,340
这话什和 么意 意思

What do you mean?

523
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:34,050
我将儿子托付给你 但是你却背产了他

| entrusted a Son to you and you treated him dishonestly.

524
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,520
如果你一直想要另外一个男人 那为什么当初要巡给他

fyou wanted another man why did you marry him?

525
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:39,650
我当时并不知道我想要另一个 你撒族

1didnt know 1wanted another. You're lying.

526
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,520
是的 我在撤诉

Yes, 1m lying，

527
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:45,430
为什么你要通我给出一个前后统一的解释

because you're forcing me to give a linear explanation.

528
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:48,130
然而连贯的解释几乎总是访言

And linear explanations are almost always lies.

529
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:52,670
你也对我襄过彼得罗的坏话

Youve said bad things about Pietro too.

530
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:56,340
芝人至你也文持我对抗役得罗 你当时说详了吗

Actually youve backed me up against him. Were you lying?

531
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:59,110
不 我从始至终都是站在你这边的

No, lve always been on your side，

532
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:01,740
但要遵守一个前提

but within a pact you needed to respect.

533
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,680
什么 全身心地陪伴你的丈夫和女儿

What was that? To stay with your husband, your girls.

534
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,650
但是事与愿违

But that's not how it went

535
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:11,550
现在这个前提没有了 一切都变了

The pact is broken and it all changes.

536
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,790
随你霸么做吧 阿售尔

Do as you please, Adele,

537
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,590
我是埃茉娜.格备科 我的女儿是我的女儿

| am Elena Greco and my daughters are mine.

538
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,230
我他妈才不在乎你们艾罗塔家

|dont give a damn about you Airotas.

539
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,170
现在能看出来你是埃茉娜 格雷科

lt shows that you're Elena Greco.

540
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,340
这一切都太明显了

It's all too evident

541
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,240
但这两个孩子也是我儿子的

But the girls are my son's daughters,

542
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,680
她们与我们共同生活了几乎两年

theyve been living with us for two years

543
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,150
我们绝不会让你融这样贤了她们

and we wont allow you to ruin them.

544
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,560
想想你的所作所为 会给孩子们造成的伤害

"Think of the harm youl do to your kids，”

545
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,560
我离开艾罗培家时 和痢拉曾对我这样说

Said Lila when | was leaving my family.

546
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:57,770
竹么做才是对我女儿不好 怎样才能好

But what was bad for my daughters, what was good for them?

547
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:04,010
我的不好 我的好 都体现在何处呢

And what was bad and good for me?

548
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:06,510
和垢样才能把好和不好融合在一起

How did it correspond or diverge

549
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,180
或者说分开呢

from what was bad and good for them?

550
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:21,490
你呢 你为了尼诺 抛和寞了一切你所拥有的

You're throwing away everything you are for Nino?

551
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,630
甚至不异以毁掉你的家庭为代价

You're ruining your family for him?

552
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,590
别这么做 莱农

Don't do it Lenu.

553
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,800
他会利用你 他会榨干你的血

He'l use you, he'l suck your blood

554
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:32,230
他会慢慢吞掉你生存的信念 然后将你弃之不顾

helltake away your will to live and then hel adon el

555
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,570
为什么你念这么多的书

Why did you study so much?

556
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,070
为什么我他妈会滔费目己的时间去设想

Why did 1waste my time imagining

557
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,480
你会蔡我过上幸福美满的生活

youd live a wonderful life for me, too?

558
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,280
我销了 你真是个昌痴

| was wrong, youre just an idiot.

559
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,540
这才去那不勒斯的旅程似乎极其漫长

The trip to Naples seemed extremely long.

560
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,540
随着列车行驶速度渐慢 缓缓开入城区

The more the train slowed down, gliding into the urban space,

561
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,010
更多的焦虑和疲乱侵点了我的身心

the more anxious exhaustion took hold of me.

562
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,680
曾经与我息息相关的那不勒斯

lt seemed the Naples | had ties to，

563
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,990
我正在回归的那不勒斯

that | was returning to，

564
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:26,390
已经完全被尼话取代了

was now reduced to Nino.

565
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:32,060
我们会做出什么样的决定

What decision would we make，

566
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:37,230
尤其是在我们彼此对当下的关系 丝槛没有头绪的情况下

Since we had no clue about a practical form of our relationship?

567
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,470
当我们一起住在那不勒斯 他会有什么反应

How would he react to the idea of us all living together in Naples?

568
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,640
我唯一感到明确的事情是 我的渴烹火烧火类

Alll knew was 1 was burning with desire

569
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,780
我已经等不及要再次见到他

and | couldnt wait to see him again.

570
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,190
你心中有个想法却一直没告诉我

You have athought youre not telling me.

571
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:59,950
不 这不是真的

No, its not true.

572
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,420
我想知道到搬是什么

| want to know what it js.

573
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,390
是个不能说的秘密吗 不是

ls it aforbidden thought? No.

574
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,230
那你为什么不敢看我呢

Then why wont you look at me?

575
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:12,500
为什么不看着我

Why wont you look at me?

576
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,110
我准备和我的女儿们一起搬到这里

Im ready to move here with my daughters.

577
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:40,600
我们会非常幸福 是的

Well be very happy.

578
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,630


579
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:47,440
我目己还有点儿积蓄 波得罗会在生活上给我和广儿一些帮助

| have alittle money, Pietro will help me with the girls，

580
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,110
而且我马上要签订我的新书合同了

and 1m about to sign the contract for the new book.

581
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:54,280
我想找一个光线充足 且能坐拥海景的大公寓

ld like to find a big apartment with of light and a view of the sea.

582
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:57,080
我始终很想念大海

lve 全1 missed the Seal.

583
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,490
我马上开始找合适的房子

川 start looking for a house at once.

584
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,530
我们会找到的

We find 放.

585
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,030
一定是些态烦事 我去看看

Itll be some pain in the neck, | go see.

586
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,110
Hello?

587
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,620
我能晚点再打给你吗

Can 1 call you back later?

588
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:46,330
我和你这什么来着 这些大学里的及烦事儿

What did 1say? A pain in the neck from the university.

589
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,900
我还记告诉你 莉拉给我打过电话

1forgot to tell you Lila called me.

590
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,370
她坚持要联系上你

She insists you get in touch,

591
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,210
她还继续打电话 甚至打到挨利奥诺拉家

She's been calling continuously, even to Eleonora'S.

592
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:02,010
最后我不得不叫她消停会儿 我见到了她 然后和她说了

In the end | met with her and told her to give it a rest.

593
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,650
你见到她了

You met with her?

594
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,350
对 我和她还有卡门一起 简单喝了杯咖啡

1 grabbed a coffee with her and Carmen.

595
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:10,120
你二么没跟我说

Why didn't you tell me?

596
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:14,860
因为我不想让你担心 她俩真是一团乱

1didnt want to upset you, those two are messed up.

597
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:20,260
我只能况 她一直在问关于你的问题

Lila only asked questions about you:

598
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,970
她想台站你的穿着打扮 你有没有换友型

how you dress, youve changed your hairstyle,

599
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:26,100
你在公众场合友言是什么样子的

how you are when you 0下 in public.

600
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:29,470
而另一个快疯的女人 坚持想让你和加利亚尼女士谈一谈

That other Ilunatic wants you to speak to Mrs. Galliani，

601
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,410
因为娜迪亚正捧在法国避难

because Nadia has taken refuge in France

602
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:35,680
她想知道 是否有她哥哥由斯卡某的消息

and maybe she has news of her brother Pasquale.

603
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,880
你从来没什么空采时间 那是时候抽出空来了

You never have a free moment yet you found the time.…

604
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,760
你是在吧她俩的酷吗

612
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,240
我回那不勒斯生活的决定

我不希翌她掺和进我的事情中
