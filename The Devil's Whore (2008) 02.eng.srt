1
0:00:04,540 --> 0:00:06,550
If you pray

2
0:00:06,560 --> 0:00:09,930
until you can pray no more.

3
0:00:10,570 --> 0:00:13,900
If you sigh to the breaking of your loins.

4
0:00:13,930 --> 0:00:17,040
And every sigh a tear,

5
0:00:17,050 --> 0:00:20,340
and every tear a drop of blood.

6
0:00:20,350 --> 0:00:26,190
Yet will you have lost all by the commission of that one sin

7
0:00:26,200 --> 0:00:28,930
of disobedience!

8
0:00:28,940 --> 0:00:33,450
When your hearts swelled with false pride

9
0:00:33,470 --> 0:00:36,930
and God's command was disobeyed,

10
0:00:36,940 --> 0:00:40,210
then came all the other sins.

11
0:00:40,220 --> 0:00:43,210
Of murder and adultery

12
0:00:43,220 --> 0:00:45,360
and fornication!

13
0:00:45,730 --> 0:00:50,330
And when God's voice in England was stopped,

14
0:00:51,060 --> 0:00:54,830
when our great nation descended into darkness,

15
0:00:55,660 --> 0:01:03,380
Then came female licentiousness and whoredom all around us.

16
0:01:04,630 --> 0:01:08,790
For what woman now knows her place in the world?

17
0:01:10,550 --> 0:01:12,140
Who are you?

18
0:01:12,150 --> 0:01:15,930
I am as I am. Pull him down.

19
0:01:19,470 --> 0:01:20,890
Leave him!

20
0:01:26,020 --> 0:01:27,210
There is no Hell.

21
0:01:27,220 --> 0:01:28,970
She blasphemes!

22
0:01:28,980 --> 0:01:30,300
Except when your children cry,

23
0:01:30,300 --> 0:01:31,520
No women preachers!

24
0:01:31,520 --> 0:01:33,000
with empty bellies.

25
0:01:34,370 --> 0:01:38,250
There is no heaven, except where you find the universal love

26
0:01:38,250 --> 0:01:40,000
that is there in your hearts.

27
0:01:41,170 --> 0:01:43,260
Be not afraid of these phantoms

28
0:01:43,260 --> 0:01:45,840
that are nothing but the nightmares

29
0:01:45,840 --> 0:01:48,090
of his foolish imaginings and all like him

30
0:01:48,100 --> 0:01:50,590
that would keep you in your accustomed places.

31
0:01:51,920 --> 0:01:54,270
Arrest her! Bring her out!

32
0:01:56,200 --> 0:01:58,150
Away with her!

33
0:02:00,800 --> 0:02:02,430
Take her away.

34
0:02:07,300 --> 0:02:08,800
The Palace of Whitehall London

35
0:02:08,850 --> 0:02:10,420
Bring her.

36
0:02:12,440 --> 0:02:14,540
What shall I call you now, madam?

37
0:02:16,800 --> 0:02:18,350
Your prisoner, my Lord?

38
0:02:18,890 --> 0:02:20,030
No.

39
0:02:21,080 --> 0:02:22,840
Mistress Sexby, then.

40
0:02:24,590 --> 0:02:27,340
Your friends, the Ranters,

41
0:02:28,010 --> 0:02:30,070
the High Attainers...

42
0:02:32,710 --> 0:02:37,120
They find holiness in tobacco and alcohol and fornication.

43
0:02:37,130 --> 0:02:39,620
God in an ivy leaf,

44
0:02:39,630 --> 0:02:41,280
God in yourselves.

45
0:02:41,290 --> 0:02:42,440
And the Bible is wastepaper.

46
0:02:42,440 --> 0:02:43,670
Who tells you this?

47
0:02:44,360 --> 0:02:48,930
I fear you mean to crush us as you did the Levellers.

48
0:02:48,940 --> 0:02:50,950
Bluntly, madam,

49
0:02:50,960 --> 0:02:54,530
in a world without Hell, how will I uphold the law?

50
0:02:56,690 --> 0:02:59,470
Was this the freedom you fought so bravely for,

51
0:02:59,470 --> 0:03:00,570
my Lord General?

52
0:03:00,970 --> 0:03:02,800
All that we fought for is in the balance.

53
0:03:02,810 --> 0:03:06,280
There is anarchy abroad and the Parliament want an iron hand.

54
0:03:06,290 --> 0:03:08,810
The Parliament wants money and land.

55
0:03:09,290 --> 0:03:12,530
It took my land, gave it to Master Joliffe to enjoy for life.

56
0:03:12,540 --> 0:03:14,710
Master Joliffe, who called me a whore.

57
0:03:15,070 --> 0:03:17,710
There are some that would like the clocks to be turned back.

58
0:03:17,720 --> 0:03:20,680
But I will not let them, for all their bleating in Parliament.

59
0:03:20,690 --> 0:03:24,370
Then leave my friends free to speak the love in their hearts.

60
0:03:28,410 --> 0:03:29,490
You are certain of their hearts?

61
0:03:29,490 --> 0:03:32,520
We seek an honest way to live on earth now,

62
0:03:32,530 --> 0:03:34,950
not in terror of what's to come.

63
0:03:38,600 --> 0:03:41,130
Yet you blaspheme, madam.

64
0:03:41,140 --> 0:03:42,830
What, will you burn me?

65
0:03:42,840 --> 0:03:45,170
Put a branding iron on me?

66
0:03:47,410 --> 0:03:49,240
Hang me?

67
0:03:50,470 --> 0:03:52,610
Have a care, Angelica.

68
0:03:54,250 --> 0:03:55,840
There is a world of difference

69
0:03:55,840 --> 0:03:58,220
between freedom and licentiousness.

70
0:04:00,870 --> 0:04:03,780
And think of me as your friend.

71
0:04:09,710 --> 0:04:15,090
Visit me. My old friends, they veer away from me now.

72
0:04:33,610 --> 0:04:34,890
My lady.

73
0:04:45,560 --> 0:04:47,630
This is the body of Christ.

74
0:04:49,070 --> 0:04:51,040
This is the blood of Christ!

75
0:05:04,710 --> 0:05:06,810
I must confess to you.

76
0:05:09,990 --> 0:05:12,460
My heart is not true.

77
0:05:12,570 --> 0:05:15,510
It betrays me every hour that I'm with you.

78
0:05:16,780 --> 0:05:19,460
I'm lured on a desire

79
0:05:19,470 --> 0:05:23,060
that a world tells me what I conceive with you is sin.

80
0:05:23,510 --> 0:05:25,900
Is love a sin, madam?

81
0:05:27,010 --> 0:05:28,390
Tell me...

82
0:05:28,580 --> 0:05:30,640
it is not a sin.

83
0:05:34,350 --> 0:05:37,030
I am married, Christian.

84
0:05:37,040 --> 0:05:39,370
In outward form only.

85
0:05:39,380 --> 0:05:41,680
Yet I will not dishonour him.

86
0:05:47,190 --> 0:05:48,940
Why did you resign your commission?

87
0:05:54,700 --> 0:05:57,430
Still no better man for a fight in these islands.

88
0:05:57,700 --> 0:05:59,200
I am finished with fighting.

89
0:05:59,210 --> 0:06:01,450
Well then, I have other work for you.

90
0:06:02,030 --> 0:06:04,830
Honest John has met with the Cavaliers.

91
0:06:04,840 --> 0:06:08,140
They've talked about bringing in the King's son from France.

92
0:06:08,150 --> 0:06:10,050
I know this to be true.

93
0:06:10,710 --> 0:06:11,490
How "know it"?

94
0:06:11,490 --> 0:06:14,600
We have agents among the malcontents.

95
0:06:16,380 --> 0:06:17,750
What work?

96
0:06:19,910 --> 0:06:23,090
Go to them, as one disaffected with me.

97
0:06:23,090 --> 0:06:26,820
And seek out their thoughts and their strength.

98
0:06:26,850 --> 0:06:28,710
Where is Honest John now?

99
0:06:30,330 --> 0:06:31,680
Have you read this?

100
0:06:31,690 --> 0:06:33,850
He calls upon the nation to rise up against you.

101
0:06:34,430 --> 0:06:37,290
Do you not sleep easily in your palace at Hampton, my Lord?

102
0:06:37,290 --> 0:06:39,540
The country was pleased to show its gratitude

103
0:06:39,540 --> 0:06:42,000
to my Lord for his many services.

104
0:06:42,010 --> 0:06:44,720
Parliament gave it. I remember not the country being asked.

105
0:06:44,730 --> 0:06:48,140
Perhaps Master Sexby need not act the part of disaffected.

106
0:06:48,150 --> 0:06:51,850
I could not tolerate this, Edward. This is open rebellion.

107
0:06:51,860 --> 0:06:52,690
Then put him on trial.

108
0:06:52,690 --> 0:06:55,810
Where's the jury that will find him guilty?

109
0:06:56,530 --> 0:06:58,440
No. No trial.

110
0:06:58,450 --> 0:07:00,760
If you move against him without the law,

111
0:07:00,920 --> 0:07:03,320
the whole of London will burn.

112
0:07:09,260 --> 0:07:11,000
Do you smell smoke?

113
0:07:12,540 --> 0:07:14,230
Honest John is even now sailing

114
0:07:14,240 --> 0:07:17,310
for Jersey where the writ of Habeas Corpus does not run.

115
0:07:18,870 --> 0:07:20,790
Give me your answer tomorrow.

116
0:07:20,970 --> 0:07:22,110
Have it now.

117
0:07:23,460 --> 0:07:25,870
I will not act parts.

118
0:07:26,170 --> 0:07:27,710
Have a care, Edward.

119
0:07:27,720 --> 0:07:30,910
We must all bend to the times, all of us.

120
0:07:31,960 --> 0:07:35,310
What will not bend may break.

121
0:07:36,510 --> 0:07:37,660
Tomorrow.

122
0:07:45,310 --> 0:07:47,910
You must pull your wife out of the Ranters, sir.

123
0:07:47,920 --> 0:07:50,080
She does not wear my reins, sir.

124
0:07:50,090 --> 0:07:52,530
A pity for her and for you.

125
0:07:52,540 --> 0:07:55,320
She runs to her utter destruction.

126
0:08:50,720 --> 0:08:52,490
How's the game?

127
0:08:52,690 --> 0:08:54,830
Near won, sir.

128
0:08:56,400 --> 0:08:59,890
Is she debauched? Have you had her yet?

129
0:09:01,390 --> 0:09:02,640
Not yet.

130
0:09:03,580 --> 0:09:05,660
You are too slow.

131
0:09:06,640 --> 0:09:09,490
It must happen today. For all to see.

132
0:09:09,500 --> 0:09:12,290
Troopers come to arrest the fornicators.

133
0:09:45,840 --> 0:09:50,030
Cry out, Master Joliffe, and I will open your nose like a fig.

134
0:09:50,080 --> 0:09:51,820
Now, tell me...

135
0:09:52,030 --> 0:09:54,140
what must be done today?

136
0:09:58,410 --> 0:10:02,640
A whore will be unmasked...

137
0:10:06,590 --> 0:10:07,980
Kill him!

138
0:10:15,330 --> 0:10:17,280
Christian...

139
0:10:19,250 --> 0:10:21,940
..I know you have a true heart...

140
0:10:25,170 --> 0:10:27,640
..but I...

141
0:10:58,630 --> 0:11:00,180
You wanted freedom, madam.

142
0:11:00,190 --> 0:11:01,920
It's found you.

143
0:11:04,230 --> 0:11:06,590
You wanted universal love.

144
0:11:07,190 --> 0:11:10,800
Well, here it is. The genuine resurrection.

145
0:11:11,510 --> 0:11:14,470
The world turned upside down.

146
0:11:14,560 --> 0:11:16,370
And here, your portion...

147
0:11:16,530 --> 0:11:20,480
though you made me wait a weary year for it.

148
0:11:37,800 --> 0:11:39,720
Arrest her!

149
0:12:31,840 --> 0:12:35,250
He that poisoned you is food for dogs now.

150
0:12:36,880 --> 0:12:39,510
He was in paid service.

151
0:12:41,300 --> 0:12:42,880
His task, to debauch you

152
0:12:42,880 --> 0:12:45,710
and bring further ridicule upon the Ranters.

153
0:12:52,600 --> 0:12:54,160
Who?

154
0:12:54,180 --> 0:12:55,860
Joliffe.

155
0:12:57,450 --> 0:12:59,730
That should have died in Wightham Woods.

156
0:12:59,920 --> 0:13:01,900
Yet he will die...

157
0:13:02,320 --> 0:13:03,460
and soon.

158
0:13:03,470 --> 0:13:06,080
Leave him, Sexby.

159
0:13:08,010 --> 0:13:11,530
He is an account that must be settled.

160
0:13:11,690 --> 0:13:13,850
I will settle it.

161
0:13:24,720 --> 0:13:25,880
There is food.

162
0:13:25,890 --> 0:13:28,190
Sexby...        Call for coals.

163
0:13:29,190 --> 0:13:31,150
I will return tonight.

164
0:13:40,880 --> 0:13:43,020
Thank you.

165
0:14:04,460 --> 0:14:06,150
Are you unwell?

166
0:14:06,160 --> 0:14:07,680
No.

167
0:14:08,850 --> 0:14:10,500
All is well.

168
0:14:10,860 --> 0:14:13,470
Nothing is ill. I-I will return.

169
0:14:13,920 --> 0:14:15,110
They have silenced Honest John.

170
0:14:15,110 --> 0:14:17,460
They have murdered Thomas Rainsborough.

171
0:14:17,790 --> 0:14:21,540
There is none but us now.

172
0:14:45,380 --> 0:14:48,430
Can you love a fool?

173
0:14:51,200 --> 0:14:53,860
For that I have been.

174
0:15:01,630 --> 0:15:05,180
My love began on the day you married Harry Fanshawe.

175
0:15:05,740 --> 0:15:08,930
I did not know I had a heart until that hour.

176
0:15:10,190 --> 0:15:12,260
You filled it with...

177
0:15:13,780 --> 0:15:17,110
..unknown creatures,

178
0:15:17,650 --> 0:15:20,030
whose names were joy

179
0:15:20,400 --> 0:15:22,460
and hope.

180
0:15:23,950 --> 0:15:28,320
Both sharper blades than any that had cut me before.

181
0:15:30,350 --> 0:15:32,830
I have something of yours.

182
0:15:37,750 --> 0:15:40,260
I've kept it on me every day.

183
0:15:41,980 --> 0:15:44,360
Then do not part with it now.

184
0:15:44,370 --> 0:15:47,200
As I will not with you.

185
0:15:47,820 --> 0:15:50,940
If you will take me.

186
0:16:02,320 --> 0:16:04,780
You do not say "aye", sir.

187
0:16:06,210 --> 0:16:08,250
I cannot take Rainsborough's widow to me

188
0:16:08,260 --> 0:16:11,100
while his murderers still walk the earth.

189
0:16:11,610 --> 0:16:15,770
Even yesterday, scenes of abominable lewdness

190
0:16:15,780 --> 0:16:20,280
and fornication were uncovered among the Ranters.

191
0:16:20,540 --> 0:16:25,670
While this House nods asleep and speaks of toleration.

192
0:16:26,230 --> 0:16:30,500
Sirs, this "toleration" will undo us all!

193
0:16:30,660 --> 0:16:34,350
Let the fornicators be brought before magistrates and be punished.

194
0:16:34,360 --> 0:16:39,450
Their lewd ill manners do not argue an end to religious toleration.

195
0:16:39,460 --> 0:16:41,820
Now you have other business today, I am told.

196
0:16:51,060 --> 0:16:54,100
The motion is that this House declares that no authority

197
0:16:54,100 --> 0:16:56,500
shall end this House's sessions...

198
0:16:56,510 --> 0:16:57,480
Will you persist, sirs?

199
0:16:57,490 --> 0:16:58,660
..except its own authority.

200
0:16:58,670 --> 0:17:00,500
You will keep yourselves here in perpetuity?!

201
0:17:00,510 --> 0:17:02,640
Those for the motion say "Aye".        Aye

202
0:17:02,910 --> 0:17:05,320
Stop, enough!

203
0:17:07,520 --> 0:17:09,850
I'll put an end to your prattling.

204
0:17:09,860 --> 0:17:13,500
You are no Parliament! Get you gone!

205
0:17:13,510 --> 0:17:15,490
Go, call them in!

206
0:17:20,720 --> 0:17:22,590
Get you gone.

207
0:17:27,510 --> 0:17:30,220
Take your hands from me!

208
0:17:30,230 --> 0:17:32,510
And take this bauble with you!

209
0:17:48,550 --> 0:17:51,600
Mount Orgruil Isle of Jersey

210
0:18:18,640 --> 0:18:19,970
What is this place?

211
0:18:19,980 --> 0:18:21,130
Mont Orgeuil.

212
0:18:21,140 --> 0:18:23,010
In English - "Mount Pride".

213
0:18:24,240 --> 0:18:26,910
It is your pride has got you your new home.

214
0:18:28,550 --> 0:18:30,420
Do not hope to leave here.

215
0:18:30,430 --> 0:18:32,650
This is your tomb, sir.

216
0:18:34,220 --> 0:18:36,690
Bring me pen and ink. When Oliver hears of this...

217
0:18:36,700 --> 0:18:39,410
No pen and ink ever again, Master Lilburne.

218
0:18:39,890 --> 0:18:42,520
It is the Lord General himself has sent you here.

219
0:18:43,330 --> 0:18:46,790
And since you may not write, you have no need of candles.

220
0:19:03,310 --> 0:19:06,150
You have doubts, Edward.

221
0:19:08,800 --> 0:19:11,300
Will you play a part with the Cavalier party?

222
0:19:11,310 --> 0:19:13,030
Do you have agents among all the parties?

223
0:19:13,030 --> 0:19:14,530
That you need not know.

224
0:19:14,530 --> 0:19:16,770
How long have you had agents amongst the Royalist party?

225
0:19:16,770 --> 0:19:18,150
Sir,I have other business...

226
0:19:18,150 --> 0:19:19,790
Had you agents among the Royalists

227
0:19:19,790 --> 0:19:21,910
at the time of Rainsborough's murder?

228
0:19:22,420 --> 0:19:24,390
Why were those men heard to cry out

229
0:19:24,390 --> 0:19:26,230
that they came from Cromwell?

230
0:19:27,620 --> 0:19:31,350
I will tell my Lord that your answer was no.

231
0:19:31,360 --> 0:19:33,190
He will not be pleased.

232
0:19:33,200 --> 0:19:35,280
I will tell him myself.

233
0:19:36,350 --> 0:19:39,980
Then find him at Westminster, for there he stays.

234
0:19:41,200 --> 0:19:43,110
Sexby...

235
0:19:45,040 --> 0:19:47,460
Only madmen oppose us now.

236
0:19:47,570 --> 0:19:50,160
I pray you be not mad.

237
0:19:54,070 --> 0:19:56,010
At Westminster. Come.

238
0:19:56,020 --> 0:19:58,030
Sexby, stay. Talk with me.

239
0:19:58,800 --> 0:20:01,860
We talked the night he was cut in pieces. No more talk.

240
0:20:03,220 --> 0:20:05,520
Edward! Are you with me again?

241
0:20:05,640 --> 0:20:06,930
Sexby!

242
0:20:09,780 --> 0:20:11,190
What is it, Edward?

243
0:20:12,320 --> 0:20:14,830
My Lord, we came to ask mercy for John Lilburne

244
0:20:14,840 --> 0:20:17,250
and to pray you, when will he have his trial?

245
0:20:18,080 --> 0:20:19,730
Never, madam.

246
0:20:20,130 --> 0:20:21,910
Then when will he be free?

247
0:20:23,220 --> 0:20:25,090
Again, never.

248
0:20:25,590 --> 0:20:27,530
When will his wife and children see him?

249
0:20:27,540 --> 0:20:30,960
Once more, madam. Never.

250
0:20:32,080 --> 0:20:34,290
Come, Edward, all this you know.

251
0:20:36,480 --> 0:20:38,560
Stand out of my way.

252
0:20:41,350 --> 0:20:44,710
Did you order the murder of Thomas Rainsborough?

253
0:20:52,520 --> 0:20:54,240
Sexby, no!

254
0:20:55,060 --> 0:20:57,540
He is unwell, my Lord. His brain is hot, he is sick,

255
0:20:57,550 --> 0:20:59,800
he is ever your Lordship's loving servant.

256
0:21:00,190 --> 0:21:02,640
Hurt not a hair on his head.

257
0:21:03,010 --> 0:21:04,530
He was a brother to me.

258
0:21:04,540 --> 0:21:06,540
Take him to the coast and put him out of England tonight.

259
0:21:06,550 --> 0:21:10,010
Sexby, if you return ever, I will have you hanged.

260
0:21:10,490 --> 0:21:11,960
Away.

261
0:21:12,180 --> 0:21:14,730
Farewell, Madam. Settle all accounts.

262
0:21:15,080 --> 0:21:16,840
Sexby!

263
0:21:17,380 --> 0:21:21,370
Pray you, let me go with him. He is all I have left now.

264
0:21:29,180 --> 0:21:31,190
Let him go, madam, from whence he came.

265
0:21:31,200 --> 0:21:32,120
There is fighting in the Low Countries.

266
0:21:32,120 --> 0:21:33,540
He will find wages there.

267
0:21:34,140 --> 0:21:38,290
Edward was never happy except he was cutting throats.

268
0:21:39,010 --> 0:21:40,630
He is not for you.

269
0:22:44,920 --> 0:22:47,520
Why do you dally? Where's my wine?

270
0:22:49,740 --> 0:22:52,840
I came with what speed I could, sir.

271
0:22:53,520 --> 0:22:55,470
Are you impatient?

272
0:22:58,480 --> 0:23:01,730
Truly this day has been a long while in the coming.

273
0:23:02,060 --> 0:23:06,830
Well, the Whore is a man again.

274
0:23:08,460 --> 0:23:12,800
You are an abomination in the eyes of God and of all godly men.

275
0:23:12,800 --> 0:23:15,710
Why have you persecuted me, sirrah?

276
0:23:15,850 --> 0:23:18,640
Because you are the age, madam.

277
0:23:18,850 --> 0:23:22,220
Weak, womanish, lustful...

278
0:23:22,700 --> 0:23:25,370
and not a one of you knows where you should be.

279
0:23:25,380 --> 0:23:26,670
Where should we be?

280
0:23:26,680 --> 0:23:28,510
You, madam, should be dead.

281
0:23:28,790 --> 0:23:30,700
I watched you hang.

282
0:23:30,820 --> 0:23:34,300
I saw your pretty ankles kicking at the clouds.

283
0:23:37,980 --> 0:23:40,820
Would I had pulled the rope myself.

284
0:23:41,150 --> 0:23:43,690
Then I would be a phantom.

285
0:23:45,450 --> 0:23:48,590
And phantoms cannot harm us.

286
0:23:49,020 --> 0:23:52,730
But, sir, I am not your crippled imaginings.

287
0:23:54,280 --> 0:23:58,970
I am flesh and blood.

288
0:24:31,620 --> 0:24:34,330
Speak not of Edward Sexby, I beg of you.

289
0:24:34,330 --> 0:24:36,130
He is gone and that is flat.

290
0:24:36,300 --> 0:24:39,230
Elizabeth Lilburne will not kneel before you

291
0:24:39,240 --> 0:24:42,770
because her husband forbade her ever ask a favour of the tyrant.

292
0:24:42,780 --> 0:24:44,790
But I kneel on her behalf.

293
0:24:48,020 --> 0:24:49,700
Walk with me.

294
0:24:53,180 --> 0:24:55,480
I never looked for ought of this.

295
0:24:56,000 --> 0:24:57,910
I was just a farmer.

296
0:24:58,060 --> 0:25:01,150
God showed me the way to lead men in battle.

297
0:25:01,810 --> 0:25:04,590
I never thought to have the nation's care in my...

298
0:25:05,000 --> 0:25:07,460
weak sinner's hands.

299
0:25:11,560 --> 0:25:14,100
Will you eat a simple supper with me, Angelica?

300
0:25:16,250 --> 0:25:18,250
So have you forgiven me?

301
0:25:20,120 --> 0:25:21,560
For what?

302
0:25:23,140 --> 0:25:24,890
I took a husband from you.

303
0:25:25,100 --> 0:25:26,700
You took two.

304
0:25:28,000 --> 0:25:29,990
When you sent Thomas Rainsborough to Pontefract,

305
0:25:29,990 --> 0:25:33,390
it was to cut the head off the Levellers, was it not?

306
0:25:37,330 --> 0:25:38,770
Aye, it was.

307
0:25:38,770 --> 0:25:41,580
Did you strike him down, Oliver?

308
0:25:45,430 --> 0:25:48,780
I would have... faced him in the field.

309
0:25:48,780 --> 0:25:50,860
I would have...

310
0:25:51,360 --> 0:25:53,600
..killed him there, with God's help.

311
0:25:54,650 --> 0:25:57,410
He was murdered by the Cavaliers, Angelica,

312
0:25:57,410 --> 0:25:59,880
as God is my witness.

313
0:26:10,360 --> 0:26:12,520
And if he had killed you in the field?

314
0:26:13,900 --> 0:26:14,900
A different England.

315
0:26:14,900 --> 0:26:17,610
If Thomas sat here now, instead of Oliver,

316
0:26:18,270 --> 0:26:19,880
what would be different?

317
0:26:20,510 --> 0:26:21,890
With Thomas and freedom.

318
0:26:21,900 --> 0:26:23,550
Oliver and tyranny?

319
0:26:25,410 --> 0:26:27,420
Oliver and order,

320
0:26:28,380 --> 0:26:29,960
Thomas...

321
0:26:31,050 --> 0:26:32,280
and convulsion.

322
0:26:32,280 --> 0:26:34,340
Then if convulsion, then famine.

323
0:26:34,350 --> 0:26:36,580
If famine then where is the freedom?

324
0:26:37,960 --> 0:26:40,200
Where is freedom for Honest John?

325
0:26:43,540 --> 0:26:46,920
Each new day brings another plot to assassinate me

326
0:26:46,930 --> 0:26:49,750
and bring us closer to anarchy and terror.

327
0:26:51,090 --> 0:26:52,930
In times like this...

328
0:26:53,720 --> 0:26:58,040
some of the freedoms we fought for must be sacrificed.

329
0:26:58,770 --> 0:27:00,370
There is nothing that now stands

330
0:27:00,370 --> 0:27:02,600
between us and utter destruction,

331
0:27:03,410 --> 0:27:04,960
but me.

332
0:27:07,040 --> 0:27:09,680
Almighty God chose me,

333
0:27:10,510 --> 0:27:14,510
not Thomas Rainsborough nor any one else. He chose me.

334
0:27:18,240 --> 0:27:20,910
And he chooses the path I must now follow.

335
0:27:23,390 --> 0:27:25,030
I would have your understanding

336
0:27:25,030 --> 0:27:27,320
of what I must now give to the nation.

337
0:27:29,110 --> 0:27:31,000
Which is what?

338
0:27:32,350 --> 0:27:35,500
They will never be settled until they have a King again.

339
0:27:37,610 --> 0:27:40,010
And what is the word "King" but a bauble,

340
0:27:40,010 --> 0:27:42,280
it's a feather in the cap.

341
0:27:42,650 --> 0:27:43,560
Well, why not in mine?

342
0:27:43,560 --> 0:27:45,950
I thought Honest John had lost his senses

343
0:27:45,960 --> 0:27:48,760
when he told us this day would come.

344
0:27:54,400 --> 0:27:56,460
So did I, madam.

345
0:27:56,910 --> 0:27:58,410
Well, then...

346
0:28:00,730 --> 0:28:03,400
King Oliver I.

347
0:28:04,970 --> 0:28:09,560
And England will have another King, chosen by God.

348
0:28:11,610 --> 0:28:15,100
Was so much blood spilt for so little?

349
0:28:27,130 --> 0:28:30,650
I came to petition you for Elizabeth Lilburne.

350
0:28:32,560 --> 0:28:35,240
What is your answer, my Lord?

351
0:28:35,340 --> 0:28:37,900
Your petitions are granted.

352
0:28:39,830 --> 0:28:44,140
She shall have a pension. She may visit the island.

353
0:28:44,790 --> 0:28:46,570
Angelica.

354
0:28:48,210 --> 0:28:49,880
Prepare Elizabeth.

355
0:28:51,730 --> 0:28:54,150
Freeborn John Lilburne is...

356
0:28:54,630 --> 0:28:56,810
broken in pieces.

357
0:28:59,210 --> 0:29:01,450
Fare you well, Oliver.

358
0:29:03,530 --> 0:29:05,800
We shall never meet again.

359
0:29:13,310 --> 0:29:16,890
What? Shall Honest John Lilburne die?

360
0:29:18,570 --> 0:29:21,820
Six and 60,000 will know the reason why!

361
0:29:25,880 --> 0:29:28,360
But where are the six and 60,000?

362
0:29:30,670 --> 0:29:36,380
Not here. Nowhere.

363
0:29:37,240 --> 0:29:38,920
Nowhere.

364
0:29:41,020 --> 0:29:43,050
Empty words

365
0:29:43,470 --> 0:29:46,010
spoken in another world.

366
0:30:09,740 --> 0:30:11,260
John?

367
0:30:13,660 --> 0:30:15,610
John?

368
0:30:21,750 --> 0:30:26,190
The Tyrant commanded I should die with no further sight of you.

369
0:30:26,700 --> 0:30:28,620
How can you be here?

370
0:30:28,700 --> 0:30:30,750
It matters not how, John.

371
0:30:31,100 --> 0:30:32,870
We are here.

372
0:30:42,360 --> 0:30:44,830
Do you bring me pen and ink?

373
0:30:44,840 --> 0:30:46,410
No, John.

374
0:30:47,470 --> 0:30:49,950
I bring you what is better.

375
0:30:50,220 --> 0:30:52,870
A first sight of your son, Benomy.

376
0:30:53,180 --> 0:30:55,130
How here?

377
0:30:57,430 --> 0:30:59,750
The Tyrant will free me?

378
0:30:59,900 --> 0:31:01,750
No, John.

379
0:31:03,300 --> 0:31:05,660
Angelica!

380
0:31:07,040 --> 0:31:08,960
Here is your son, sir.

381
0:31:16,430 --> 0:31:19,090
If he frees me not,

382
0:31:19,540 --> 0:31:22,410
then by what means are you come here?

383
0:31:22,420 --> 0:31:24,420
He is ill. Take the boy.

384
0:31:24,430 --> 0:31:26,220
Come here, boy.

385
0:31:26,740 --> 0:31:30,960
Behold! Behold your abandoned father!

386
0:31:32,530 --> 0:31:36,340
Did I not forbid that you should ask the tyrant any favour?

387
0:31:36,350 --> 0:31:37,960
I asked him, John.

388
0:31:37,970 --> 0:31:39,940
I don't know who you are, madam.

389
0:31:40,130 --> 0:31:42,900
I don't know this boy child. I have no son.

390
0:31:44,660 --> 0:31:46,690
I know only this.

391
0:31:47,470 --> 0:31:50,880
The woman I formerly loved.

392
0:31:51,410 --> 0:31:54,000
The woman that you "formerly loved",

393
0:31:54,560 --> 0:31:56,450
gave her life without question

394
0:31:56,450 --> 0:32:00,450
or complaint to a man "In love with a crown of thorns"!

395
0:32:00,480 --> 0:32:02,210
Think, sir,

396
0:32:02,220 --> 0:32:04,030
what I might have been had I not loved a man

397
0:32:04,030 --> 0:32:06,760
who each new day nailed himself to the cross of freedom.

398
0:32:07,840 --> 0:32:10,930
And where is that freedom now, sir?

399
0:32:11,920 --> 0:32:15,090
And where was that freedom ever for me?

400
0:32:20,590 --> 0:32:23,580
John, I couldn't bring you pen and paper.

401
0:32:24,620 --> 0:32:28,860
I feared they might execute you if you took up the pen.

402
0:32:29,310 --> 0:32:31,840
I have feared that all our lives.

403
0:32:32,860 --> 0:32:35,120
No matter now, Beth.

404
0:32:38,430 --> 0:32:41,100
It was all mistaken.

405
0:32:43,280 --> 0:32:45,390
What was mistaken, John?

406
0:32:46,580 --> 0:32:49,050
To change the temporal world.

407
0:32:50,120 --> 0:32:53,100
All that matters is what waits for us.

408
0:32:53,430 --> 0:32:56,120
Elizabeth, he knows not what he says.

409
0:32:56,140 --> 0:32:58,260
Indeed I do, madam.

410
0:33:01,340 --> 0:33:04,520
When I am free, I will take up my cross.

411
0:33:05,830 --> 0:33:09,310
I will crucify the pride in me.

412
0:33:10,940 --> 0:33:14,400
I will tell Oliver do the same.

413
0:33:14,410 --> 0:33:16,570
I cannot tell him.

414
0:33:17,270 --> 0:33:19,180
Cannot tell me?

415
0:33:20,010 --> 0:33:22,110
Cannot tell me what, madam?

416
0:33:26,660 --> 0:33:30,880
Though he will call himself Lord Protector still,

417
0:33:31,870 --> 0:33:34,780
Oliver is to be King.

418
0:33:47,280 --> 0:33:48,990
Forgive me.

419
0:33:50,160 --> 0:33:51,770
For what?

420
0:33:54,890 --> 0:33:56,540
All.

421
0:33:59,370 --> 0:34:01,820
Until the last of my days,

422
0:34:02,110 --> 0:34:04,130
my proudest boast will ever be

423
0:34:04,140 --> 0:34:08,720
that I was the wife of Freeborn John Lilburne.

424
0:34:33,470 --> 0:34:34,860
Bring him!

425
0:34:41,120 --> 0:34:42,720
Hurry, sirs.

426
0:34:53,840 --> 0:34:55,580
Put him in.

427
0:34:55,590 --> 0:34:57,620
Here lies Freeborn...

428
0:34:57,630 --> 0:34:58,530
No speeches.

429
0:34:58,540 --> 0:35:00,930
I will be damned before I will let you silence her!

430
0:35:00,940 --> 0:35:02,700
This is my land you're standing on.

431
0:35:02,710 --> 0:35:04,920
Madam, I was told no speeches.

432
0:35:17,710 --> 0:35:19,880
To your work, sirs.

433
0:35:21,100 --> 0:35:24,470
And you to your homes.

434
0:36:14,700 --> 0:36:16,990
I thought I had lost you.

435
0:36:17,000 --> 0:36:18,820
Not yet.

436
0:36:21,320 --> 0:36:23,190
Good sir.

437
0:36:26,390 --> 0:36:27,790
When the world began its turning,

438
0:36:27,790 --> 0:36:32,890
I little thought I would be turned so utterly.

439
0:36:36,690 --> 0:36:38,170
Nor I.

440
0:36:40,010 --> 0:36:41,410
Come.

441
0:36:42,410 --> 0:36:44,840
Mistress mine.

442
0:37:32,530 --> 0:37:34,390
First peep.

443
0:37:36,530 --> 0:37:38,810
The dark is clearing...

444
0:37:40,070 --> 0:37:44,630
like mist uprising from the water land where I began.

445
0:37:51,830 --> 0:37:54,180
Jack has his Jill.

446
0:37:56,260 --> 0:37:58,970
Then naught shall go ill.

447
0:38:00,050 --> 0:38:02,660
Sexby, why have you come back?

448
0:38:08,550 --> 0:38:11,030
To kill the King.

449
0:38:20,260 --> 0:38:23,680
Every schoolboy will learn the name of Edward Sexby.

450
0:38:26,080 --> 0:38:29,330
That he set England free of its chains.

451
0:38:32,000 --> 0:38:33,700
And I will be free.

452
0:38:36,510 --> 0:38:38,870
What is it you look for?

453
0:38:40,990 --> 0:38:42,850
Nothing, madam.

454
0:38:44,510 --> 0:38:48,190
But I swear on my life that I do love thee.

455
0:38:53,060 --> 0:38:55,390
Then give this up...

456
0:38:57,170 --> 0:39:00,580
..and come with me to the New World.

457
0:39:03,090 --> 0:39:06,120
You must have the life you choose.

458
0:39:06,720 --> 0:39:08,860
I fear my ending will not be yours.

459
0:39:11,220 --> 0:39:12,860
Must all end in blood?

460
0:39:12,860 --> 0:39:14,960
Aye...

461
0:39:16,100 --> 0:39:18,320
..all must end in blood.

462
0:39:35,850 --> 0:39:37,590
One week hence,

463
0:39:37,690 --> 0:39:41,050
on the day of Oliver's glory, wait for me at the sea.

464
0:39:42,490 --> 0:39:45,590
If the parish bells welcome England's new King,

465
0:39:45,770 --> 0:39:47,810
think not to see me again.

466
0:39:48,680 --> 0:39:50,840
I will not be given to the butchers.

467
0:39:51,930 --> 0:39:54,770
That day will shake the world, madam.

468
0:39:56,600 --> 0:39:58,980
And all the blood will not have been in vain.

469
0:40:02,310 --> 0:40:04,500
Do you know me, Angelica?

470
0:40:06,360 --> 0:40:07,990
Aye, Edward.

471
0:40:10,430 --> 0:40:12,970
You are yourself.

472
0:40:36,140 --> 0:40:38,380
There are many now among us

473
0:40:38,380 --> 0:40:40,800
who see him as a traitor and a tyrant.

474
0:40:41,750 --> 0:40:45,320
He will get the nation's thanks, if he does this.

475
0:40:46,360 --> 0:40:48,860
This is your place, sir.

476
0:40:49,530 --> 0:40:52,630
Here I will make my horse seem lame.

477
0:40:52,640 --> 0:40:54,760
His carriage will have to stop.

478
0:41:34,040 --> 0:41:35,740
Good morrow to you.

479
0:41:35,750 --> 0:41:38,410
Good morrow, Your Highness.

480
0:41:38,540 --> 0:41:39,830
Nay.

481
0:41:40,040 --> 0:41:42,360
Let me be Old Noll a few hours more.

482
0:41:45,110 --> 0:41:46,450
Toop?

483
0:41:47,430 --> 0:41:49,410
Today you ride before me.

484
0:41:49,850 --> 0:41:52,710
I recall a time I rode before you, do you remember?

485
0:41:52,970 --> 0:41:55,560
At Kineton fight, My Lord.

486
0:41:55,960 --> 0:41:57,810
It was a brave fight.

487
0:41:58,490 --> 0:42:00,250
Aye, My Lord.

488
0:42:00,970 --> 0:42:02,450
I remember.

489
0:42:10,150 --> 0:42:12,100
I remember you well.

490
0:42:14,210 --> 0:42:15,570
Did you not fight near me

491
0:42:15,570 --> 0:42:17,860
when we saved Honest John and his dragoon?

492
0:42:18,210 --> 0:42:19,790
Very near, My Lord.

493
0:42:21,950 --> 0:42:24,790
Do you remember Free Born John? How he fought...

494
0:42:25,350 --> 0:42:28,740
until he was one heartbeat away from paradise.

495
0:42:30,480 --> 0:42:33,150
I robbed him of a martyr's death

496
0:42:33,600 --> 0:42:35,360
and he never forgave me.

497
0:42:36,930 --> 0:42:42,530
I remember John Lilburne every night in my prayers, My Lord.

498
0:42:44,990 --> 0:42:46,960
As do I, Toop.

499
0:42:55,940 --> 0:42:58,230
Did you ever think this day would come?

500
0:43:00,750 --> 0:43:01,650
No...

501
0:43:02,000 --> 0:43:04,320
My Lord, I did not.

502
0:44:31,160 --> 0:44:33,020
Cromwell comes!

503
0:44:33,030 --> 0:44:35,330
Clear a way for the lord protector!

504
0:44:48,010 --> 0:44:49,540
May God forgive me.

505
0:44:49,880 --> 0:44:53,350
My Lord, I cannot let you proceed any further.

506
0:46:39,820 --> 0:46:43,210
God save the Lord Protector!

507
0:46:45,790 --> 0:46:51,600
Long live his Highness! God save the Lord Protector!

508
0:46:51,610 --> 0:46:54,190
God save the Lord Protector!

509
0:47:36,090 --> 0:47:38,450
'On the day Sexby died,

510
0:47:38,460 --> 0:47:43,650
'the new life he left me was already quick within me.'

511
0:47:59,450 --> 0:48:02,030
'After Beth entered her new world.

512
0:48:02,040 --> 0:48:05,590
'Oliver departed the old one he'd turned upside down.'

513
0:48:05,600 --> 0:48:07,650
Oh, Lord...

514
0:48:09,470 --> 0:48:13,700
Give them consistency of judgment.

515
0:48:13,870 --> 0:48:15,190
Our father...

516
0:48:15,200 --> 0:48:17,680
One heart.

517
0:48:20,130 --> 0:48:22,380
And mutual love.

518
0:48:23,440 --> 0:48:26,060
'The second King Charles came over the water,

519
0:48:26,070 --> 0:48:29,190
'and the fountains of London ran with wine.'

520
0:48:30,520 --> 0:48:31,840
Elizabeth.

521
0:48:33,330 --> 0:48:35,600
Look up there in those branches.

522
0:48:36,050 --> 0:48:37,700
Do you see anything?

523
0:48:46,970 --> 0:48:48,780
Do you see anything?

524
0:48:49,750 --> 0:48:52,990
I see leaves and sky.

525
0:48:59,050 --> 0:49:01,210
'All my men were dead.'

526
0:49:01,220 --> 0:49:06,440
'Their hopes and dreams gone with them,'

527
0:49:06,450 --> 0:49:10,370
'yet we are the world we live in,

528
0:49:10,380 --> 0:49:12,510
'the world we love in.

529
0:49:12,820 --> 0:49:17,220
'These were the life and times of Angelica Fanshawe.

'joy and hope.'
