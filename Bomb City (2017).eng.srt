1
0:02:28,640 --> 0:02:30,470
It's now or never, motherfuckers!

2
0:02:30,480 --> 0:02:32,010
We end this shit tonight.

3
0:02:35,680 --> 0:02:39,380
"Destroy everything."

4
0:02:39,380 --> 0:02:43,990
Is this the message we want to send our children

5
0:02:43,990 --> 0:02:45,520
for generations to come?

6
0:02:46,560 --> 0:02:49,560
"Destroy... everything."

7
0:02:53,930 --> 0:02:56,930
This, ladies and gentlemen,

8
0:02:56,940 --> 0:03:02,570
is what that weapon-wielding goon wore the night of the altercation.

9
0:03:02,570 --> 0:03:05,580
Looks to me like he was on a mission to kill.

10
0:03:09,820 --> 0:03:12,020
Combat boots,

11
0:03:12,820 --> 0:03:13,920
war chains...

12
0:03:17,760 --> 0:03:19,320
And this.

13
0:03:19,690 --> 0:03:21,890
"Destroy everything."

14
0:03:26,060 --> 0:03:27,470
How's it going, new york?

15
0:03:27,470 --> 0:03:34,470
I chose to speak to you in a square because I think we're kind of conditioned to listen to people,

16
0:03:34,470 --> 0:03:35,910
when they're in the shape of a square.

17
0:03:35,910 --> 0:03:39,010
And also, here in hollywood,

18
0:03:39,010 --> 0:03:42,510
this is where we give people what they want.

19
0:03:42,510 --> 0:03:46,880
Violence, I guess that's what it seems to come down to.

20
0:03:46,890 --> 0:03:49,120
What I wanted to talk to everyone today about,

21
0:03:49,120 --> 0:03:51,120
uh... I don't really want to preach,

22
0:03:51,120 --> 0:03:53,960
I just want to, more, bring up some questions.

23
0:03:53,960 --> 0:04:00,430
And since I always tend to be a scapegoat, I thought we'd talk about blame.

24
0:04:00,430 --> 0:04:02,100
Right now, everybody wants to blame music,

25
0:04:02,100 --> 0:04:03,170
they want to blame movies,

26
0:04:03,170 --> 0:04:05,740
but, uh... you know,

27
0:04:05,740 --> 0:04:11,170
we've forgotten that we have a dead guy hanging from a tree in our living rooms.

28
0:04:13,040 --> 0:04:15,580
And that's something that we've worshipped all our lives.

29
0:04:15,580 --> 0:04:17,950
If you think about the crucifix as the...

30
0:04:17,950 --> 0:04:22,620
The greatest mass-market piece of merchandise in the history of the world.

31
0:04:22,620 --> 0:04:24,660
I've always found it to be kind of interesting.

32
0:04:24,660 --> 0:04:28,090
We haven't really sat down and talked about that on the news.

33
0:04:28,090 --> 0:04:34,100
Um... also, wondered why nobody cares when an adult commits some senseless act of violence

34
0:04:34,100 --> 0:04:36,440
they want to have a reason why.

35
0:04:36,470 --> 0:04:38,270
That's only when a kid does it.

36
0:04:38,670 --> 0:04:40,940
But I think what's really...

37
0:04:40,940 --> 0:04:43,510
Begun to confuse people now

38
0:04:43,510 --> 0:04:46,980
and why we're in this state of... uh, chaos

39
0:04:46,980 --> 0:04:51,520
and, uh, pc, nonsensical, uptightness.

40
0:04:51,520 --> 0:04:53,680
It's white teenagers.

41
0:04:53,690 --> 0:04:55,190
That's the real enigma.

42
0:04:55,190 --> 0:04:56,590
Why are they mad?

43
0:04:56,590 --> 0:04:57,920
They're middle class,

44
0:04:57,920 --> 0:04:59,620
they're white, they're spoiled.

45
0:04:59,620 --> 0:05:03,170
Is it because they know america's a lie?

46
0:05:03,170 --> 0:05:04,690
Is it because we make them feel

47
0:05:04,700 --> 0:05:07,100
like they're never good enough, you know?

48
0:05:07,100 --> 0:05:08,630
"You're never good enough for the scholarship,

49
0:05:08,630 --> 0:05:11,570
for the car, for the girl.

50
0:05:11,570 --> 0:05:15,240
Never good enough to be famous for 15 minutes."

51
0:05:15,240 --> 0:05:18,010
And then, are we surprised why they're mad

52
0:05:18,010 --> 0:05:20,240
or why they end up dead, you know?

53
0:05:20,250 --> 0:05:22,150
Why the violence?

54
0:05:22,820 --> 0:05:24,280
'Cause, you know...

55
0:05:24,920 --> 0:05:26,980
You made them, america.

56
0:05:26,990 --> 0:05:28,120
You know, what do you expect?

57
0:05:33,490 --> 0:05:35,800
Come on, get your game day sports stuff.

58
0:05:35,820 --> 0:05:39,580
Come on, get your game day sports stuff.

59
0:05:48,170 --> 0:05:49,210
Shit, yeah.

60
0:05:49,210 --> 0:05:51,640
Hey, quit messing around, man.

61
0:05:51,640 --> 0:05:54,210
Why? I don't even see why your bitch-ass needs a helmet anyway.

62
0:05:54,210 --> 0:05:56,280
Jv has no business suiting up.

63
0:05:57,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Come on now, ricky.

64
0:05:58,020 --> 0:05:59,760
He might see the field.

65
0:06:00,160 --> 0:06:02,190
We'll have their ass beat by halftime, you know that.

66
0:06:02,820 --> 0:06:04,750
Mccormick, you act like it's hard to be a lineman, man.

67
0:06:04,760 --> 0:06:06,530
All you do is sit on your fat ass and eat.

68
0:06:08,560 --> 0:06:10,860
Buddy, only thing I'm eating is your mom's pussy.

69
0:06:13,700 --> 0:06:15,530
What... get... get the fuck off me!

70
0:06:15,530 --> 0:06:17,700
Quit freakin' playing grab-ass, man!

71
0:06:17,700 --> 0:06:19,640
It's a playoff game!

72
0:06:19,640 --> 0:06:21,240
Act like it!

73
0:06:21,240 --> 0:06:23,140
Let it go, cody.

74
0:06:23,140 --> 0:06:24,510
Come on, let's bring it in, men.

75
0:06:26,080 --> 0:06:27,650
Our father, who art in heaven,

76
0:06:27,650 --> 0:06:29,580
hallowed by thy name.

77
0:06:29,580 --> 0:06:31,950
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,

78
0:06:31,950 --> 0:06:34,250
on earth as it is in heaven.

79
0:06:34,250 --> 0:06:36,620
Give us this day our daily bread.

80
0:06:36,620 --> 0:06:38,160
And forgive us our trespasses,

81
0:06:38,160 --> 0:06:41,030
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

82
0:06:41,030 --> 0:06:42,830
And lead us not into temptation,

83
0:06:42,830 --> 0:06:44,730
but deliver us from evil.

84
0:06:44,730 --> 0:06:46,030
For thine is the kingdom,

85
0:06:46,030 --> 0:06:48,330
the power, the glory forever

86
0:06:48,330 --> 0:06:50,070
and ever. Hey, what's up, bri?

87
0:06:50,070 --> 0:06:51,230
Good to see you, man.

88
0:06:51,240 --> 0:06:52,840
Where you been? New york.

89
0:06:52,840 --> 0:06:54,570
Good, yeah. The show's already going on.

90
0:06:54,570 --> 0:06:55,740
The show must go on!

91
0:06:58,680 --> 0:06:59,810
Hey, what's up, man?

92
0:07:01,280 --> 0:07:04,310
My brother inside? Yeah, he's in there somewhere.

93
0:07:11,160 --> 0:07:12,890
How we looking?

94
0:07:12,890 --> 0:07:14,920
Uh, good...

95
0:07:14,930 --> 0:07:15,960
What's up, dawg?

96
0:07:35,250 --> 0:07:36,550
What the fuck!

97
0:07:38,820 --> 0:07:40,750
Dude! Oh!

98
0:07:45,660 --> 0:07:46,660
Brian?

99
0:07:46,660 --> 0:07:48,730
Brian! Dude!

100
0:07:51,300 --> 0:07:53,900
No, no, no, I ain't letting you off that easy.

101
0:07:53,900 --> 0:07:55,930
Get your ass up here and do the song list.

102
0:07:55,930 --> 0:07:57,840
Get up here.

103
0:08:01,040 --> 0:08:03,110
Let me tell you something about this dude right here...

104
0:08:05,980 --> 0:08:08,980
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for this kid right here!

105
0:08:15,890 --> 0:08:17,150
Cheers, bro.

106
0:10:23,380 --> 0:10:25,540
Hey, you got a light?

107
0:10:26,520 --> 0:10:28,290
You know those things take 14 minutes off your life

108
0:10:28,290 --> 0:10:29,790
every time you smoke one of them?

109
0:10:29,790 --> 0:10:31,290
What are you, a psychic?

110
0:10:33,560 --> 0:10:35,490
I only smoke when I drink.

111
0:10:35,490 --> 0:10:38,260
Yeah, how much have you had to drink tonight?

112
0:10:38,260 --> 0:10:42,030
Well, I'm sorry, the guy who can down a 40 ounce beer in like five seconds

113
0:10:42,030 --> 0:10:44,070
is questioning me about drinking?

114
0:10:44,070 --> 0:10:46,940
Well, you know what they say, a bottle of malt liquor a day keeps the doctor away.

115
0:10:46,940 --> 0:10:48,140
Really? And how many bottles

116
0:10:48,140 --> 0:10:49,470
have you had tonight?

117
0:10:49,470 --> 0:10:51,480
Don't worry about it.

118
0:10:56,880 --> 0:10:58,280
Look at this fucker.

119
0:10:58,280 --> 0:10:59,850
What's happening, man?

120
0:11:01,520 --> 0:11:03,920
Shit, I didn't think you'd make it back in time.

121
0:11:03,920 --> 0:11:05,220
I'm not gonna miss the show.

122
0:11:05,220 --> 0:11:07,320
Thought we lost you to the road.

123
0:11:07,330 --> 0:11:09,930
Psh. Should've known this black hole would suck you back in.

124
0:11:09,930 --> 0:11:12,460
Never fails.

125
0:11:12,460 --> 0:11:13,460
Killer show.

126
0:11:13,470 --> 0:11:14,960
Glad to have you back.

127
0:11:14,970 --> 0:11:16,070
Fuck yeah, dawg.

128
0:11:16,070 --> 0:11:17,330
Fuck.

129
0:11:17,340 --> 0:11:18,500
Fucked my ankle up in there.

130
0:11:18,500 --> 0:11:19,870
Shut the fuck up, king, all right?

131
0:11:19,870 --> 0:11:20,870
Dude.

132
0:11:20,870 --> 0:11:21,970
All right, sunshine,

133
0:11:21,970 --> 0:11:24,540
tell this asshole that skinheads are racist.

134
0:11:24,540 --> 0:11:26,040
First of all,

135
0:11:26,050 --> 0:11:27,510
stop calling me"sunshine."

136
0:11:27,510 --> 0:11:29,880
Read a fucking book.

137
0:11:29,880 --> 0:11:33,050
This shit was started way before any of that racist shit came around.

138
0:11:33,050 --> 0:11:35,050
He's right, it goes way back. Straight up, though.

139
0:11:35,050 --> 0:11:36,150
Straight-laced bitch.

140
0:11:36,150 --> 0:11:38,050
Okay, fuck y'all.

141
0:11:38,060 --> 0:11:40,160
Crass, let's roll, come on.

142
0:11:40,160 --> 0:11:41,390
Catch up with y'all in a bit.

143
0:11:42,960 --> 0:11:44,300
Yo, help me clean some shit up.

144
0:11:48,030 --> 0:11:49,200
Hey! There he is!

145
0:11:51,200 --> 0:11:52,370
Tiny human.

146
0:11:52,370 --> 0:11:53,900
What's up, dude? What's your name?

147
0:11:53,910 --> 0:11:55,870
What's up? Jake.

148
0:11:57,140 --> 0:11:59,310
Digging that hat. Oh, this?

149
0:11:59,310 --> 0:12:00,980
Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

150
0:12:00,980 --> 0:12:02,210
You have a good time at the show?

151
0:12:02,210 --> 0:12:04,050
It was a damn good show.

152
0:12:05,220 --> 0:12:07,380
Actually, it's my first show.

153
0:12:07,390 --> 0:12:09,390
No fucking way. Yeah.

154
0:12:10,890 --> 0:12:12,390
I got an idea.

155
0:12:12,390 --> 0:12:14,160
Come with me. Come on.

156
0:12:18,660 --> 0:12:22,500
Yo. Yo, I want to introduce you to my little buddy, jake.

157
0:12:22,500 --> 0:12:24,530
He just got his concert cherry popped tonight.

158
0:12:24,540 --> 0:12:26,040
Hell yeah, little dude.

159
0:12:26,040 --> 0:12:27,100
You have a good time?

160
0:12:27,110 --> 0:12:29,010
Yeah, for sure.

161
0:12:29,010 --> 0:12:30,540
Starting them young, love it.

162
0:12:30,540 --> 0:12:32,110
That's how we do it. Yeah.

163
0:12:32,110 --> 0:12:33,310
Hey, would you sign my hat?

164
0:12:33,310 --> 0:12:34,310
Of course.

165
0:12:37,980 --> 0:12:39,950
Here you are.

166
0:12:39,950 --> 0:12:41,150
Yo, thanks. You got it, bro.

167
0:12:41,150 --> 0:12:42,250
That's what's up.

168
0:12:42,250 --> 0:12:44,220
See you later. All right. Yo...

169
0:12:45,100 --> 0:12:47,360
It's not much...

170
0:12:47,360 --> 0:12:49,030
Ah. ...But here's your cut.

171
0:12:49,030 --> 0:12:51,060
Hell yeah. Thanks, man.

172
0:12:51,060 --> 0:12:53,530
Long as we make it to the 505, it's all good. That should do the trick.

173
0:12:53,530 --> 0:12:55,200
Dude...

174
0:12:55,200 --> 0:12:56,470
Thank you.

175
0:12:56,470 --> 0:12:58,330
You got it. Killer show.

176
0:12:58,340 --> 0:13:00,570
Well, unless you've been living under a rock,

177
0:13:00,570 --> 0:13:03,140
I'm sure you heard the outcome of tonight's 5-8

178
0:13:03,140 --> 0:13:05,340
division I quarterfinal playoff game

179
0:13:05,340 --> 0:13:08,380
between the rebels and the rabbits,

180
0:13:08,380 --> 0:13:10,480
and boy was it ugly.

181
0:13:10,480 --> 0:13:13,550
That is, if you were rooting for the rebels.

182
0:13:13,550 --> 0:13:17,720
46 to 3, you heard that right, folks.

183
0:13:17,720 --> 0:13:19,290
Better luck next season, rebels.

184
0:13:20,960 --> 0:13:22,210
What do y'all want to do now?

185
0:13:22,210 --> 0:13:25,590
I guess get wasted. I mean, what's better to do in this town?

186
0:13:25,600 --> 0:13:27,360
Yeah, it's been a while since I've had a beer.

187
0:13:27,370 --> 0:13:29,700
Yeah, well, it's now or never.

188
0:13:29,700 --> 0:13:30,940
What time is it?

189
0:13:34,170 --> 0:13:35,640
Fuck.

190
0:13:35,640 --> 0:13:36,640
It's 12:15.

191
0:13:36,640 --> 0:13:38,210
Son of a bitch.

192
0:13:38,210 --> 0:13:39,550
Dumbass laws, man.

193
0:14:15,780 --> 0:14:17,250
Frosty!

194
0:14:17,250 --> 0:14:18,620
What's up, boss? What up, what up?

195
0:14:20,720 --> 0:14:22,720
Hey, you got to come to our next show, bro.

196
0:14:22,720 --> 0:14:24,350
I'm telling you, you'll love it.

197
0:14:24,360 --> 0:14:26,090
Thanks, boss.

198
0:14:27,590 --> 0:14:29,390
Fuck yeah. It's gonna take a lot of praying

199
0:14:29,390 --> 0:14:32,030
to fix that freak show. Fucking pussies.

200
0:14:51,250 --> 0:14:52,680
For you, princess.

201
0:14:54,620 --> 0:14:56,290
For you.

202
0:14:57,660 --> 0:14:59,530
Me first.

203
0:15:02,090 --> 0:15:03,360
My love.

204
0:15:03,360 --> 0:15:05,300
Aw, how sweet.

205
0:15:05,830 --> 0:15:07,400
Bro-bro.

206
0:15:17,140 --> 0:15:19,810
You know, I think that we should give it a try,

207
0:15:19,810 --> 0:15:22,680
you know what I'm saying? Me and you together...

208
0:15:26,790 --> 0:15:28,290
Yeah. Maybe.

209
0:15:28,290 --> 0:15:30,120
Yeah! She said"yes"!

210
0:15:32,720 --> 0:15:35,490
What's up, faggot? Fuck around and find out.

211
0:15:35,490 --> 0:15:38,400
You're a fucking freak, man.

212
0:15:38,400 --> 0:15:39,770
Fucking pussy.

213
0:15:41,600 --> 0:15:45,370
Fucking tweaker reeks. What's wrong with him?

214
0:15:45,370 --> 0:15:48,300
That bitch-ass motherfucker's about to get fucking boxed, dawg.

215
0:15:48,310 --> 0:15:50,710
Which one? That fucking bitch-ass right there with the fucking tie.

216
0:15:59,650 --> 0:16:01,680
Those fucking losers, man.

217
0:16:01,690 --> 0:16:03,420
Think they might like you, cody.

218
0:16:03,420 --> 0:16:05,790
Fuck you, mccormick.

219
0:16:08,860 --> 0:16:10,490
You got my nightstick, bro?

220
0:16:10,500 --> 0:16:12,100
Yeah.

221
0:16:39,620 --> 0:16:41,730
Aw, you piece of shit.

222
0:16:42,760 --> 0:16:43,760
What, bitch?

223
0:16:43,760 --> 0:16:45,160
Fuck you.

224
0:16:45,160 --> 0:16:46,430
Oh, yeah? What's up, what's up?

225
0:16:46,430 --> 0:16:48,930
What, bitch?

226
0:16:48,930 --> 0:16:50,830
Dude, chill the fuck out, dawg. What, bitch?

227
0:16:50,840 --> 0:16:52,540
Do something. Let's get the fuck out of here.

228
0:16:52,540 --> 0:16:54,570
Do something, bruh. Fuck you too, bitch.

229
0:16:54,570 --> 0:16:56,370
Do something, bruh. Whoa,"bitch"?

230
0:16:56,370 --> 0:16:58,280
I'm trying to maintain the peace, dawg.

231
0:16:58,280 --> 0:16:59,640
You don't want to fuck with me, fool.

232
0:16:59,640 --> 0:17:01,750
If it's on, it's fucking on.

233
0:17:01,750 --> 0:17:03,550
Suck my dick, you fucking freak show.

234
0:17:03,550 --> 0:17:04,920
"Freak show"? I'll show you freak show

235
0:17:04,920 --> 0:17:06,550
when I bash your dome in, bruh. Huh?

236
0:17:06,550 --> 0:17:08,190
I'm gonna bash your fucking dome in, dawg!

237
0:17:09,320 --> 0:17:10,390
Hey, god damn it.

238
0:17:10,390 --> 0:17:12,290
Hey, hey, take it outside!

239
0:17:12,290 --> 0:17:13,520
Let's go, outside!

240
0:17:13,530 --> 0:17:15,690
I'm calling the damn cops. Outside!

241
0:17:15,690 --> 0:17:17,460
Outside! Hey, hey!

242
0:17:21,430 --> 0:17:23,530
Hey, what now, bitch? I'm gonna fuck you up.

243
0:17:23,540 --> 0:17:24,940
Where you going, dawg?

244
0:17:24,940 --> 0:17:26,140
Where you going, man?

245
0:17:28,240 --> 0:17:30,640
Yo, you're lucky your faggot fucking friends are here to save you.

246
0:17:30,640 --> 0:17:32,640
Oh, they got nothing to do with this, man.

247
0:17:32,640 --> 0:17:33,980
This got everything to do with you, me,

248
0:17:33,980 --> 0:17:37,750
that pussy-ass look on your face and my fucking friend here, man!

249
0:17:37,750 --> 0:17:39,420
Oh, you like that? Fuck you,

250
0:17:39,420 --> 0:17:40,420
you fucking piece of shit.

251
0:17:40,420 --> 0:17:41,850
That's right, bitch.

252
0:17:41,850 --> 0:17:42,890
That's right.

253
0:17:42,890 --> 0:17:44,420
Roll the fuck out.

254
0:17:44,420 --> 0:17:45,690
Roll the fuck out, bruh.

255
0:17:46,990 --> 0:17:48,790
The fuck you going, bruh? Yo!

256
0:17:50,390 --> 0:17:51,530
Fuck yeah, that's right, bitch!

257
0:17:51,530 --> 0:17:52,800
Hey, he's coming back,

258
0:17:52,800 --> 0:17:53,900
he's coming back, he's coming back.

259
0:17:53,900 --> 0:17:54,970
Get the fuck out of here.

260
0:18:08,910 --> 0:18:12,650
Please tell the court how you would describe yourself,

261
0:18:12,650 --> 0:18:13,960
your lifestyle.

262
0:18:15,820 --> 0:18:16,590
I don't know.

263
0:18:17,460 --> 0:18:18,510
Punk?

264
0:18:18,960 --> 0:18:20,340
"Punk"?

265
0:18:21,730 --> 0:18:23,200
Funny you would say that.

266
0:18:25,030 --> 0:18:27,530
Because webster's dictionary...

267
0:18:29,370 --> 0:18:32,770
Gives us the following definition of this term

268
0:18:32,770 --> 0:18:37,780
you so eloquently use to describe yourself: Punk.

269
0:18:39,320 --> 0:18:41,780
"A worthless person;

270
0:18:41,780 --> 0:18:44,910
an often aggressive or violent young man,

271
0:18:44,920 --> 0:18:47,850
usually a petty hoodlum or gangster;

272
0:18:48,470 --> 0:18:49,640
a sociopath."

273
0:18:52,490 --> 0:18:54,570
It's not about a definition.

274
0:18:55,060 --> 0:18:58,030
I wouldn't expect someone like you...

275
0:18:58,030 --> 0:18:59,030
To understand that.

276
0:18:59,030 --> 0:19:01,800
Oh, well, then please help me.

277
0:19:02,730 --> 0:19:09,180
Help the jury understand how wearing chains and military clothing is just part of the style,

278
0:19:09,210 --> 0:19:11,040
and not weapons at the ready.

279
0:19:13,880 --> 0:19:15,680
It's a statement.

280
0:19:15,680 --> 0:19:16,780
Oh, you are correct,

281
0:19:16,800 --> 0:19:19,440
it most certainly is a statement.

282
0:19:19,460 --> 0:19:22,110
But it is not a statement of fashion,

283
0:19:22,570 --> 0:19:25,230
it's a statement of malicious intent.

284
0:20:16,250 --> 0:20:18,420
My head's pounding.

285
0:20:21,290 --> 0:20:24,030
It's not your head, man, there's someone at the door.

286
0:20:36,560 --> 0:20:38,000
Herschel, what's happening, man?

287
0:20:39,530 --> 0:20:40,660
What's the deal?

288
0:20:40,660 --> 0:20:42,000
Rent was due last week.

289
0:20:42,000 --> 0:20:44,030
Ah, I know, I do.

290
0:20:44,040 --> 0:20:45,400
I got a little behind.

291
0:20:47,070 --> 0:20:48,370
Here's this.

292
0:20:51,780 --> 0:20:52,780
It's short.

293
0:20:52,780 --> 0:20:54,580
I know.

294
0:20:54,580 --> 0:20:56,080
But just give us a little bit more time,

295
0:20:56,080 --> 0:20:57,780
and I promise I'll get you the rest.

296
0:20:59,180 --> 0:21:01,150
I like you all and what you're doing and all,

297
0:21:01,150 --> 0:21:02,690
but I need the money.

298
0:21:02,690 --> 0:21:04,020
I can't have y'all squatting in here.

299
0:21:04,020 --> 0:21:06,680
I'm already giving you a break on price, man.

300
0:21:07,490 --> 0:21:08,860
I know.

301
0:21:08,860 --> 0:21:10,190
And we appreciate it.

302
0:21:11,730 --> 0:21:12,730
I'm just... I'm trying.

303
0:21:12,730 --> 0:21:14,900
You know, it's...

304
0:21:14,900 --> 0:21:16,900
Dude, you know I'm good for it.

305
0:21:16,900 --> 0:21:19,600
These shows, they're starting to go really well.

306
0:21:19,600 --> 0:21:22,720
I just need like a week and I'll figure it out.

307
0:21:24,140 --> 0:21:25,570
All right, but that's it.

308
0:21:25,580 --> 0:21:27,180
All right? I'm serious this time.

309
0:21:27,180 --> 0:21:29,210
I honestly can't wait any longer, all right?

310
0:21:29,210 --> 0:21:32,150
One week or I got to lock it up, man.

311
0:21:32,150 --> 0:21:34,040
Okay. And, herschel, thank you.

312
0:21:35,490 --> 0:21:36,950
I promise, you won't regret this.

313
0:21:36,950 --> 0:21:38,620
All right. I promise.

314
0:21:38,620 --> 0:21:39,660
Thank you.

315
0:21:39,660 --> 0:21:40,820
One week!

316
0:21:52,770 --> 0:21:56,540
You know, it's gonna be hard for you to get a job looking like a wild indian.

317
0:21:56,540 --> 0:21:58,610
Don't worry about me, old man, I got a few things lined up.

318
0:21:58,730 --> 0:22:00,850
Oh, I'm not worried, that's your mother's job.

319
0:22:05,000 --> 0:22:07,150
I guess a helmet's out of the question, too.

320
0:22:07,150 --> 0:22:08,490
I'm not trying to look like an idiot.

321
0:22:09,490 --> 0:22:10,990
You could've fooled me.

322
0:22:14,830 --> 0:22:16,660
How dangerous...

323
0:22:18,560 --> 0:22:21,160
This is the last of the megadeath weapons.

324
0:22:21,170 --> 0:22:23,770
A huge bomb, nine megatons.

325
0:22:23,770 --> 0:22:30,610
It has more explosive power than all the missiles fired from one of our nuclear-armed submarines today.

326
0:22:30,610 --> 0:22:32,680
And could be detonated by a variety of ways:

327
0:22:32,680 --> 0:22:34,880
A spark, a lightning storm

328
0:22:34,880 --> 0:22:36,750
or even a hit could set it off.

329
0:22:36,770 --> 0:22:38,520
But we have dismantled others like this...

330
0:22:38,940 --> 0:22:40,840
Who were you talking to out there?

331
0:22:41,080 --> 0:22:42,310
Ran into an old friend.

332
0:22:42,820 --> 0:22:44,090
Told you I'd come.

333
0:22:44,090 --> 0:22:45,790
Oh! Who is this?

334
0:22:45,790 --> 0:22:50,160
I'll tell you what I think, I'm gonna take you down to tracy and she'll give you a good haircut.

335
0:22:51,050 --> 0:22:52,590
Sounds like a good idea to me.

336
0:22:53,100 --> 0:22:55,200
I say you just shave the whole thing.

337
0:22:55,200 --> 0:22:56,900
Make you look like a real man.

338
0:22:58,030 --> 0:23:00,810
Smells good, ma.

339
0:23:00,830 --> 0:23:03,540
You make enough for everybody? Between you and your brother,

340
0:23:03,540 --> 0:23:04,540
I never know who's gonna be here

341
0:23:04,540 --> 0:23:06,540
so I always try.

342
0:23:06,550 --> 0:23:08,280
Oh, and you can take some to your friends, too.

343
0:23:08,280 --> 0:23:10,550
I'm sure they could use a good meal every once and a while.

344
0:23:10,550 --> 0:23:13,020
Not trying to feed the whole neighborhood.

345
0:23:17,260 --> 0:23:18,650
What's cooking, betty?

346
0:23:22,090 --> 0:23:24,290
Yummy. Come on, man.

347
0:23:24,300 --> 0:23:26,130
You know, it's strange,

348
0:23:26,130 --> 0:23:28,000
I never heard anyone knock.

349
0:23:28,000 --> 0:23:29,770
Very funny, mr. D.

350
0:23:29,770 --> 0:23:30,870
You boys cut it out.

351
0:23:30,870 --> 0:23:31,870
Help yourself, john.

352
0:23:31,870 --> 0:23:34,040
Thank you, betty.

353
0:23:34,040 --> 0:23:36,010
Hey, pass the eggs, man.

354
0:23:36,010 --> 0:23:37,660
I ain't here to serve you.

355
0:23:37,690 --> 0:23:39,750
Get up and get them yourself.

356
0:23:47,350 --> 0:23:48,950
You looking for this?

357
0:23:48,950 --> 0:23:51,190
What the hell, mom?

358
0:23:51,190 --> 0:23:52,760
The name of your band is

359
0:23:52,760 --> 0:23:53,920
"white slave traders"?

360
0:23:53,920 --> 0:23:56,290
We're all slaves to authority, ma.

361
0:24:22,750 --> 0:24:24,790
Get your ass over here and help me real quick.

362
0:24:24,790 --> 0:24:27,160
Don't tell me what to do, I'm an anarchist!

363
0:24:27,160 --> 0:24:28,960
Kiss my ass.

364
0:24:28,960 --> 0:24:30,830
I would, but I don't want my lips to stink.

365
0:24:32,260 --> 0:24:33,360
Shit!

366
0:24:36,300 --> 0:24:37,770
Why do we do this shit, man?

367
0:24:37,770 --> 0:24:39,130
'Cause it's fun!

368
0:24:39,140 --> 0:24:40,140
This is work, not fun.

369
0:24:40,140 --> 0:24:41,640
It's both.

370
0:24:41,640 --> 0:24:44,240
Plus, we're making a mark on this town.

371
0:24:44,240 --> 0:24:46,780
This town don't give a shit.

372
0:24:46,780 --> 0:24:48,180
Shit, I know, but...

373
0:24:48,180 --> 0:24:50,680
That"amarillionare" gave us some extra cash.

374
0:24:50,680 --> 0:24:52,650
Got to love that kooky bastard.

375
0:24:52,650 --> 0:24:54,610
Yep, he's always been good to us.

376
0:24:54,640 --> 0:24:56,670
Yeah, I could definitely use the cash.

377
0:25:02,090 --> 0:25:03,430
No, but for real, though,

378
0:25:03,430 --> 0:25:05,190
what about you?

379
0:25:05,200 --> 0:25:08,060
Man, I just want to start booking bigger bands, you know?

380
0:25:08,070 --> 0:25:11,200
I feel like the scene's really picking up. - It's all possible, man,

381
0:25:11,200 --> 0:25:13,510
you just got to get the bands to make the stop.

382
0:25:13,530 --> 0:25:15,300
You just let me worry about that, all right?

383
0:25:18,140 --> 0:25:19,910
Hey, you mind locking up?

384
0:25:19,910 --> 0:25:22,010
Yeah, man, where you going?

385
0:25:22,010 --> 0:25:24,730
I just got some shit to take care of, no big deal. Need a lift?

386
0:25:24,730 --> 0:25:26,730
No, no, I'm good, I'll meet up with y'all later.

387
0:25:27,010 --> 0:25:28,150
All right, man.

388
0:25:28,870 --> 0:25:31,600
Hey, I got a surprise for y'all tonight, too.

389
0:25:31,630 --> 0:25:33,190
I think I might know what it is.

390
0:25:34,050 --> 0:25:35,640
Think it's ready?

391
0:25:35,690 --> 0:25:37,400
I think it's close.

392
0:26:26,500 --> 0:26:30,330
I think it's close.

393
0:27:57,430 --> 0:27:59,440
Whoo-hoo! What the fuck

394
0:27:59,440 --> 0:28:01,900
is up with your hair? Got ourselves a pretty one, boys.

395
0:28:01,910 --> 0:28:04,370
What are you, an el chupacabra-looking motherfucker? What's up, dawg?

396
0:28:04,370 --> 0:28:06,180
What's up, baby? The fuck you say? Huh?

397
0:28:06,180 --> 0:28:07,840
Pretty-haired little pussy.

398
0:28:07,850 --> 0:28:09,180
Oh, look at this little shit. Whoo-hoo!

399
0:28:09,180 --> 0:28:11,880
I fucked a girl in jeans like that.

400
0:28:14,920 --> 0:28:16,220
Shit head!

401
0:28:16,220 --> 0:28:19,390
Let's go! Let's go, ricky!

402
0:28:20,490 --> 0:28:23,290
Fuck you!

403
0:28:29,870 --> 0:28:30,960
Damn!

404
0:28:31,440 --> 0:28:32,620
Watch the jacket.

405
0:28:32,650 --> 0:28:33,710
My bad, my bad.

406
0:28:33,740 --> 0:28:35,040
You okay? Yeah.

407
0:28:35,210 --> 0:28:36,610
Chill out, it's all good.

408
0:28:38,040 --> 0:28:41,880
Don't just sit there, get up and get the lady another beer.

409
0:28:46,710 --> 0:28:48,110
What's this all about?

410
0:28:49,350 --> 0:28:53,930
This whole town is built to support the only nuclear weapons manufacturing facility in the nation.

411
0:28:56,090 --> 0:28:59,930
Put it together, if you were going to attack america,

412
0:28:59,930 --> 0:29:02,930
wouldn't you try to take out their most vulnerable weapons first?

413
0:29:04,040 --> 0:29:07,500
We got plutonium war heads under our feet as we speak.

414
0:29:07,510 --> 0:29:09,510
This place is just a big target, ticking.

415
0:29:09,510 --> 0:29:11,040
Ticking away.

416
0:29:12,580 --> 0:29:13,680
Bomb fucking city.

417
0:29:36,970 --> 0:29:38,400
Thanks.

418
0:30:00,160 --> 0:30:01,160
Thanks.

419
0:30:01,160 --> 0:30:03,400
Dude, of course.

420
0:30:05,840 --> 0:30:07,260
Can you promise me something?

421
0:30:07,270 --> 0:30:09,330
I don't like promises.

422
0:30:10,630 --> 0:30:11,630
Whatever,

423
0:30:11,640 --> 0:30:13,060
just hear me out.

424
0:30:14,070 --> 0:30:14,770
Sure, go ahead.

425
0:30:20,080 --> 0:30:22,980
You may think this sounds cheesy or whatever...

426
0:30:26,120 --> 0:30:27,220
Just...

427
0:30:29,920 --> 0:30:31,200
Please...

428
0:30:32,390 --> 0:30:33,830
I...

429
0:30:34,960 --> 0:30:37,150
I don't want you to leave here...

430
0:30:38,460 --> 0:30:41,790
Without being armed somehow.

431
0:30:43,300 --> 0:30:45,500
We need equalizers.

432
0:30:48,010 --> 0:30:50,700
And not just you, I mean, all of us.

433
0:30:52,180 --> 0:30:54,810
So, what, like king and his police baton?

434
0:30:54,810 --> 0:30:56,680
I think I can handle myself.

435
0:30:58,850 --> 0:31:00,050
I know.

436
0:31:02,750 --> 0:31:04,220
But...

437
0:31:04,890 --> 0:31:06,760
I don't know, like, dumb shit like this,

438
0:31:06,760 --> 0:31:08,690
it happens all the time.

439
0:31:09,390 --> 0:31:11,490
I'll just get, like, a rocket launcher or drive a tank,

440
0:31:11,500 --> 0:31:14,030
then no one will mess with me then.

441
0:31:16,200 --> 0:31:18,430
You know what I mean.

442
0:31:18,440 --> 0:31:19,900
How about a bazooka, then?

443
0:31:19,900 --> 0:31:21,070
Shut up.

444
0:31:34,190 --> 0:31:35,820
Grab this shit. Shit.

445
0:31:36,820 --> 0:31:38,320
Don't take it yet.

446
0:31:38,320 --> 0:31:39,520
Where'd you get this shit?

447
0:31:39,520 --> 0:31:42,260
I always have a secret stash.

448
0:31:42,260 --> 0:31:44,060
Why you been holding out?

449
0:31:44,060 --> 0:31:46,290
Because we hang around a bunch of fucking scavengers,

450
0:31:46,300 --> 0:31:48,100
that's why. Let's shoot this shit, come on.

451
0:31:53,510 --> 0:31:54,870
Son of a bitch!

452
0:31:54,870 --> 0:31:56,810
This is from my fucking stash.

453
0:31:56,810 --> 0:31:58,410
You're the fucking scavenger. Boys, boys, boys!

454
0:31:58,410 --> 0:32:02,010
Yes it is. I present to you the beginning...

455
0:32:02,010 --> 0:32:03,820
Of brian's bitching brew.

456
0:32:05,920 --> 0:32:07,180
This shit looks off.

457
0:32:07,190 --> 0:32:09,220
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

458
0:32:09,220 --> 0:32:11,120
All right, y'all.

459
0:32:11,120 --> 0:32:13,120
To the beginning!

460
0:32:21,330 --> 0:32:22,470
Knew that shit didn't look right.

461
0:32:22,470 --> 0:32:23,870
It's potent, though.

462
0:32:23,870 --> 0:32:25,500
That's like over 14%.

463
0:32:25,500 --> 0:32:27,840
This shit is worse than I thought.

464
0:32:27,840 --> 0:32:30,910
But... it'll do the fucking trick.

465
0:32:30,910 --> 0:32:32,880
14%,

466
0:32:32,880 --> 0:32:35,040
that's what I'm talking about

467
0:32:35,050 --> 0:32:36,810
did I hit you?

468
0:32:36,810 --> 0:32:38,410
Oh, shit, we're out.

469
0:32:38,420 --> 0:32:39,920
Move!

470
0:32:41,050 --> 0:32:43,050
What the fuck, bro?

471
0:32:43,050 --> 0:32:45,590
Victor, are you okay?

472
0:32:45,590 --> 0:32:47,190
Hell yeah!

473
0:32:49,190 --> 0:32:52,430
Out with the old and in with the new!

474
0:32:53,970 --> 0:32:56,930
Get this motherfucker a beer right here. Yeah!

475
0:33:22,030 --> 0:33:23,160
Fire in the hole, bitches.

476
0:33:23,160 --> 0:33:24,330
You better run, motherfuckers!

477
0:33:27,100 --> 0:33:28,260
Oh, shit.

478
0:33:28,270 --> 0:33:30,470
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

479
0:33:30,470 --> 0:33:32,320
Oh, shit.

480
0:33:39,240 --> 0:33:41,410
I got you, bitch!

481
0:35:00,530 --> 0:35:02,620
Dude, this party's dead, man.

482
0:35:13,300 --> 0:35:14,570
You trying to get out of here?

483
0:35:24,050 --> 0:35:27,080
Dude, don't overdo it, man, I only got a couple cans.

484
0:35:27,080 --> 0:35:29,320
Every time I go and get more,

485
0:35:29,320 --> 0:35:31,420
they give me a hard-ass fucking time.

486
0:35:31,420 --> 0:35:34,120
What kind of country has a law against how much fucking paint you can buy?

487
0:35:34,120 --> 0:35:35,620
Man, they got laws for everything.

488
0:35:35,630 --> 0:35:37,260
For the land of the free,

489
0:35:37,260 --> 0:35:40,300
you got to follow a lot of fucking rules.

490
0:35:45,000 --> 0:35:47,100
Hey, yo, dude, dude, headlights, headlights, chill.

491
0:35:49,770 --> 0:35:51,340
Fuck it!

492
0:35:53,510 --> 0:35:55,110
Shit! Fuck! Cops, cops!

493
0:35:58,780 --> 0:35:59,780
Shit! Fuck! Cops, cops!

494
0:36:04,450 --> 0:36:05,460
Come on!

495
0:36:11,800 --> 0:36:13,300
Just got to outrun your ass.

496
0:36:24,210 --> 0:36:25,570
Holy shit!

497
0:36:25,580 --> 0:36:26,810
I think we did it, bro!

498
0:36:38,060 --> 0:36:39,690
Hey, where did you guys go?

499
0:36:39,690 --> 0:36:41,790
Dude, is the front door locked?

500
0:36:41,790 --> 0:36:43,530
The fucking cops are after us, man. Fuck!

501
0:36:43,530 --> 0:36:46,260
I don't know, I'll check. What the fuck, y'all?

502
0:36:46,260 --> 0:36:47,800
What about cops? Get the fuck off him, bro.

503
0:36:47,800 --> 0:36:50,230
Did they see you come here?

504
0:36:50,230 --> 0:36:52,770
I don't know, man, they were right the fuck on top of us.

505
0:36:52,770 --> 0:36:54,500
Fuck! Then why did you come here?

506
0:36:54,510 --> 0:36:56,140
Chill!

507
0:36:56,140 --> 0:36:58,170
Will one of you shut the fuck up?

508
0:36:59,280 --> 0:37:01,110
Damn.

509
0:37:01,110 --> 0:37:02,310
Fuck. They're right the fuck outside.

510
0:37:02,310 --> 0:37:04,850
This is the apd, we know you're in there!

511
0:37:04,850 --> 0:37:07,550
If you do not let us in, we will have to force entry!

512
0:37:10,320 --> 0:37:14,160
I repeat, we will force entry! They're the fuck outside.

513
0:37:14,160 --> 0:37:15,420
You're fucking stupid! Why would you bring cops here?

514
0:37:15,430 --> 0:37:16,590
Wait, wait, wait, please shut up!

515
0:37:16,590 --> 0:37:18,230
Damn it! What the fuck, bro?

516
0:37:18,230 --> 0:37:20,100
Get her the fuck off me, man.

517
0:37:20,100 --> 0:37:22,630
Get her the fuck off me! Chill, chill, chill!

518
0:37:22,630 --> 0:37:23,400
Stop! Unit base,

519
0:37:23,400 --> 0:37:26,430
we have the perpetrators at 313 west 8th street.

520
0:37:26,440 --> 0:37:27,640
Request additional back-up,

521
0:37:27,640 --> 0:37:30,770
also request permission to force entry, over.

522
0:37:36,110 --> 0:37:37,550
Stop.

523
0:37:37,550 --> 0:37:39,450
It's already too late. Late for what?

524
0:37:41,180 --> 0:37:44,190
Hey, hey, hey. Holy shit, dawg.

525
0:37:46,820 --> 0:37:49,690
Hey, we were just tagging, bro.

526
0:37:51,700 --> 0:37:53,860
Yeah, yeah, sure. Caught red-handed!

527
0:37:53,870 --> 0:37:56,330
Fuck you! Fuck you! Caught red-handed! Caught red-handed!

528
0:37:56,330 --> 0:37:57,830
Shut the fuck up, king. Chill, chill out.

529
0:37:57,830 --> 0:37:59,770
John, shut the fuck up, dawg.

530
0:37:59,770 --> 0:38:00,800
There's like seven cops out there.

531
0:38:00,810 --> 0:38:02,810
Yo, I don't give a fuck!

532
0:38:09,750 --> 0:38:11,280
Hey, listen up.

533
0:38:11,280 --> 0:38:13,150
Shit.

534
0:38:13,150 --> 0:38:14,280
You open this door,

535
0:38:14,280 --> 0:38:16,450
nobody goes to jail.

536
0:38:16,450 --> 0:38:19,190
If you don't open this door, everybody's going to fucking jail!

537
0:38:19,190 --> 0:38:21,320
You understand me? Shh. Shh. Shh.

538
0:38:21,330 --> 0:38:22,860
There's no point in cleaning up! Hey!

539
0:38:22,860 --> 0:38:25,260
We just need to act like no one's here.

540
0:38:25,260 --> 0:38:27,300
We wait 'em out, we wait 'em out. Yeah, dawg. Hey...

541
0:38:27,300 --> 0:38:28,800
They need a fucking warrant to come in here anyways.

542
0:38:28,800 --> 0:38:29,800
Y'all know that.

543
0:38:35,870 --> 0:38:37,640
Check this out.

544
0:38:43,750 --> 0:38:45,510
Chill the fuck out, all right?

545
0:38:45,520 --> 0:38:48,450
You are such a fucking idiot, dude.

546
0:38:48,450 --> 0:38:50,320
Shut the fuck up, bro!

547
0:38:50,320 --> 0:38:51,620
What, you gonna charge up on me, dawg?

548
0:38:51,620 --> 0:38:53,760
This is gonna be fun.

549
0:38:55,560 --> 0:38:58,230
Just chill the fuck out... show us a fucking warrant.

550
0:38:58,230 --> 0:39:00,270
Show us a fucking warrant!

551
0:39:03,500 --> 0:39:05,530
We're just here for two men!

552
0:39:05,540 --> 0:39:07,670
Give them up and you can go on about your night.

553
0:39:11,210 --> 0:39:13,270
Some bullshit.

554
0:39:13,280 --> 0:39:15,210
Cops are such assholes.

555
0:39:15,210 --> 0:39:16,510
Goddamn it!

556
0:39:16,510 --> 0:39:18,810
Look, look, look, we'll just sit here,

557
0:39:18,820 --> 0:39:20,420
we'll wait 'em out, we make 'em go through the process, all right?

558
0:39:20,420 --> 0:39:21,750
It's like 4 a.M.,

559
0:39:21,750 --> 0:39:22,820
it'll take 'em forever to get a warrant.

560
0:39:22,820 --> 0:39:23,820
Nobody opens that door.

561
0:39:23,820 --> 0:39:25,850
Cut the power.

562
0:39:25,860 --> 0:39:27,690
Grab thumper.

563
0:39:27,690 --> 0:39:29,490
Show these motherfuckers what's up.

564
0:39:42,870 --> 0:39:44,640
Fuck this, I'm throwing king's ass.

565
0:39:44,640 --> 0:39:46,270
I'm not going to fucking jail! Get the fuck off me, man!

566
0:39:46,280 --> 0:39:47,810
Shut the fuck up, man. Get the fuck off of me!

567
0:39:47,810 --> 0:39:49,850
Will you shut the fuck up, fool?

568
0:39:53,480 --> 0:39:55,350
I think they're leaving, dawg.

569
0:39:55,350 --> 0:39:56,580
Yeah, yeah.

570
0:39:56,590 --> 0:39:57,990
They're leaving, dawg hell yeah!

571
0:39:57,990 --> 0:39:58,990
I told you assholes.

572
0:39:58,990 --> 0:40:01,390
They always fucking leave, man.

573
0:40:01,390 --> 0:40:03,590
Fucking haters! Shut the fuck up, man.

574
0:40:03,590 --> 0:40:05,590
Fucking haters! They wouldn't just leave.

575
0:40:05,600 --> 0:40:07,400
That's weird, man.

576
0:40:08,970 --> 0:40:10,510
Oh, shit. Dude...

577
0:40:11,600 --> 0:40:13,330
Dude, I think they cut the power.

578
0:40:13,340 --> 0:40:14,970
No shit, you fucking idiot.

579
0:40:14,970 --> 0:40:17,370
Mm. Shut the fuck up, bro.

580
0:40:23,310 --> 0:40:25,520
What's up with the power, dude?

581
0:40:28,020 --> 0:40:29,550
On the ground! Freeze!

582
0:40:29,550 --> 0:40:30,990
Head down! Hands up in the air! Now!

583
0:40:30,990 --> 0:40:33,450
You, get down, now!

584
0:40:33,460 --> 0:40:34,890
Stop moving! You hear me? Freeze!

585
0:40:34,890 --> 0:40:36,490
On the ground now! Don't move!

586
0:40:36,490 --> 0:40:38,300
Stop right there! Halt! Down on the ground!

587
0:40:40,360 --> 0:40:41,660
Get down!

588
0:40:41,670 --> 0:40:43,400
Get on the ground! Now!

589
0:40:43,400 --> 0:40:44,570
Freeze! On the ground, now!

590
0:40:44,570 --> 0:40:45,740
Stop! Freeze!

591
0:40:47,070 --> 0:40:49,670
Get the fuck off of me!

592
0:40:49,670 --> 0:40:52,310
Bitch! Bitch!

593
0:40:55,080 --> 0:40:56,380
Fall on the ground!

594
0:40:56,380 --> 0:40:57,610
Get on the ground now!

595
0:40:57,620 --> 0:41:00,580
Get the fuck off me, fucker!

596
0:41:00,580 --> 0:41:01,950
Stop! Stop resisting! I'm not!

597
0:41:01,950 --> 0:41:03,850
Hands behind your back!

598
0:41:03,850 --> 0:41:06,320
Fucking pig! Get the fuck off me!

599
0:41:06,320 --> 0:41:07,360
Get the fuck off me!

600
0:41:07,360 --> 0:41:08,560
Shut your mouth.

601
0:41:08,560 --> 0:41:09,930
I'm not your fucking kid, bitch!

602
0:41:09,930 --> 0:41:10,930
Fuck you, man.

603
0:41:12,460 --> 0:41:14,030
Fuck you!

604
0:41:14,030 --> 0:41:16,260
This is every day for me, bitch!

605
0:41:16,730 --> 0:41:18,770
Get the fuck off me! Calm down, huh?

606
0:41:18,770 --> 0:41:19,770
Get the fuck off me!

607
0:41:22,840 --> 0:41:23,910
Yeah, not so big now,

608
0:41:23,910 --> 0:41:24,910
are you, punk?

609
0:41:28,410 --> 0:41:29,450
Get the fuck up.

610
0:41:31,550 --> 0:41:32,580
Get in the chair. Fuck you!

611
0:41:32,580 --> 0:41:34,420
Now! Fuck!

612
0:41:34,420 --> 0:41:35,780
Get 'em on the wall! Get 'em!

613
0:41:35,790 --> 0:41:37,450
Hands behind your back! Come over here.

614
0:41:37,450 --> 0:41:39,090
Fuck you! Fuck! Now.

615
0:41:39,090 --> 0:41:40,620
Fuck you, bitch!

616
0:41:40,620 --> 0:41:41,620
Get your hands behind your back.

617
0:41:41,620 --> 0:41:43,760
Hands behind your back.

618
0:41:43,760 --> 0:41:45,990
You're a bitch motherfucker, dawg.

619
0:41:46,000 --> 0:41:47,700
You think they give out a fucking medal for...?

620
0:41:47,700 --> 0:41:48,900
Fuck you!

621
0:41:51,940 --> 0:41:53,940
Get the fuck off me! I didn't fucking do nothing, man.

622
0:41:53,940 --> 0:41:55,970
Take that fucking badge off and say that shit, motherfucker.

623
0:41:55,970 --> 0:41:57,840
What are you gonna do now, punk bitch?

624
0:41:57,840 --> 0:41:59,040
Take that fucking badge off and say it!

625
0:41:59,040 --> 0:42:00,680
I didn't do shit!

626
0:42:00,680 --> 0:42:03,010
We didn't do anything, we have rights!

627
0:42:03,010 --> 0:42:05,410
You lost your rights when you didn't let us in.

628
0:42:05,420 --> 0:42:07,380
We didn't fucking do anything!

629
0:42:07,390 --> 0:42:09,620
We didn't do anything! Show me the fucking warrant!

630
0:42:09,620 --> 0:42:12,120
Judging by the looks of this place,

631
0:42:12,120 --> 0:42:14,660
I'm sure all of y'all are guilty of plenty.

632
0:42:14,660 --> 0:42:16,060
Fuck you.

633
0:42:16,060 --> 0:42:18,140
Sit still, you little shit.

634
0:42:20,930 --> 0:42:22,660
Spread 'em, sweetheart.

635
0:42:37,450 --> 0:42:38,680
This is not a game.

636
0:42:38,680 --> 0:42:40,150
Get your fucking hands off me.

637
0:42:40,150 --> 0:42:42,180
Leave her alone, you fuck! She's a fucking girl!

638
0:42:42,190 --> 0:42:43,890
I said shut the fuck up! Fuck you!

639
0:43:02,710 --> 0:43:04,790
On your fucking knees!

640
0:43:06,040 --> 0:43:09,110
Looks like y'all are a bunch of real winners here.

641
0:43:23,860 --> 0:43:25,430
Fuck you!

642
0:43:25,430 --> 0:43:26,600
We didn't fucking do anything!

643
0:43:26,620 --> 0:43:27,960
Get that the fuck off her!

644
0:43:28,430 --> 0:43:29,890
Fuck you, pig!

645
0:43:29,890 --> 0:43:32,250
I'm sure your daddy's proud.

646
0:43:32,770 --> 0:43:34,440
Get the fuck off of her!

647
0:43:35,070 --> 0:43:37,600
We didn't do anything! Fuck you!

648
0:43:37,610 --> 0:43:39,570
Ow! Fuck you!

649
0:43:39,580 --> 0:43:41,580
You need to learn to shut your fucking mouth.

650
0:43:41,580 --> 0:43:42,810
Fuck you!

651
0:43:42,810 --> 0:43:44,450
You want to die tonight, motherfucker?

652
0:43:44,630 --> 0:43:46,160
Get the fuck out.

653
0:43:48,820 --> 0:43:50,490
Give him help on the wall, give him help on the wall.

654
0:43:50,490 --> 0:43:52,150
Fuck!

655
0:43:52,160 --> 0:43:53,450
Hold it right there, hold it right there!

656
0:43:57,090 --> 0:43:58,960
Calm the fuck down! What's up, dawg?

657
0:43:58,960 --> 0:44:00,560
You have the right to remain silent.

658
0:44:00,560 --> 0:44:02,260
Thought you said we didn't have any fucking rights?

659
0:44:02,270 --> 0:44:04,270
You got quite a fucking mouth on you, boy.

660
0:44:04,270 --> 0:44:06,270
Fuck you! Fuck me?

661
0:44:07,970 --> 0:44:09,170
Fuck you, motherfucker.

662
0:44:09,170 --> 0:44:11,310
Ah, fuck! Come on.

663
0:44:11,310 --> 0:44:13,380
How's that feel, bitch?

664
0:44:15,180 --> 0:44:18,260
Calm down! Stop resisting!

665
0:44:18,280 --> 0:44:20,860
Fuck! Fuck!

666
0:44:41,340 --> 0:44:43,840
Hey! You got any drugs? Where the drugs at?

667
0:44:43,840 --> 0:44:45,410
The fuck you'd say, motherfucker?

668
0:45:12,440 --> 0:45:18,870
I have in my hand multiple police reports filed over the last four years.

669
0:45:18,880 --> 0:45:23,980
All of these reports took place at the same establishment you frequented.

670
0:45:25,840 --> 0:45:27,180
Underage drinking,

671
0:45:28,320 --> 0:45:30,760
multiple accounts of excessive noise,

672
0:45:31,440 --> 0:45:35,000
multiple arrests, including minors in possession of alcohol,

673
0:45:35,590 --> 0:45:38,430
minors in consumption of alcohol,

674
0:45:38,430 --> 0:45:40,930
public intoxication, drug paraphernalia,

675
0:45:40,930 --> 0:45:43,030
resisting arrest,

676
0:45:43,030 --> 0:45:45,840
and assault of a police officer.

677
0:45:48,670 --> 0:45:52,280
Do you wish to deny any of these truths, miss hendricks?

678
0:45:55,010 --> 0:46:01,050
Or do you believe that ending up behind bars is all a matter of circumstance?

679
0:46:20,970 --> 0:46:22,500
They're so fat!

680
0:46:25,240 --> 0:46:26,570
Look at him!

681
0:46:27,540 --> 0:46:29,210
Aw, I want them all!

682
0:46:29,210 --> 0:46:30,410
This guy.

683
0:46:30,410 --> 0:46:31,710
He's, like, passed out.

684
0:46:35,720 --> 0:46:37,550
Oh, no.

685
0:46:37,550 --> 0:46:39,250
Oh, my god.

686
0:46:39,260 --> 0:46:40,720
I want him.

687
0:46:40,720 --> 0:46:42,590
I want all of them. Oh.

688
0:46:42,590 --> 0:46:44,330
Hey, hey, buddy.

689
0:46:44,330 --> 0:46:47,190
He's so little.

690
0:46:51,070 --> 0:46:52,180
Come here, bud.

691
0:46:52,700 --> 0:46:55,570
I know how you feel, little buddy.

692
0:46:55,570 --> 0:46:57,540
It's no fun being locked in a cage.

693
0:47:04,250 --> 0:47:05,610
Oh, sweetie.

694
0:47:06,350 --> 0:47:08,180
Gonna be like simba.

695
0:47:09,320 --> 0:47:10,430
What about"pistol"?

696
0:47:11,560 --> 0:47:13,030
What about"shotgun"?

697
0:47:16,290 --> 0:47:17,560
No, none of those.

698
0:47:17,560 --> 0:47:19,300
He doesn't like 'em? Uh-uh.

699
0:47:25,670 --> 0:47:27,710
What is this,"destroy everything"?

700
0:47:28,270 --> 0:47:29,370
Filth.

701
0:47:30,810 --> 0:47:32,140
Are you kidding me? You...

702
0:47:32,140 --> 0:47:33,240
Filth. Mm-mm.

703
0:47:33,240 --> 0:47:35,140
Blatz. Shit split.

704
0:47:35,140 --> 0:47:37,010
Double cd? Are you fucking kidding me?

705
0:47:37,010 --> 0:47:38,410
I'm sorry, I don't know any of those.

706
0:47:38,410 --> 0:47:40,250
Oh, my god, I feel like I failed you!

707
0:47:40,250 --> 0:47:42,980
It hurts me on the inside that you don't know what that is.

708
0:47:42,990 --> 0:47:44,450
Like...

709
0:47:44,450 --> 0:47:46,450
Hell no.

710
0:47:46,460 --> 0:47:49,890
The only thing that you failed at is naming a puppy.

711
0:47:49,890 --> 0:47:51,060
All right.

712
0:47:51,060 --> 0:47:52,960
You give it a go. Give me him.

713
0:47:52,960 --> 0:47:54,400
Hi, puppy.

714
0:47:57,830 --> 0:47:59,370
So who the fuck is filth anyway?

715
0:48:01,410 --> 0:48:03,240
It's the greatest fucking band in the world.

716
0:48:08,950 --> 0:48:10,040
Come here.

717
0:48:10,050 --> 0:48:11,480
Mm, I'm not afraid of you.

718
0:48:18,420 --> 0:48:20,260
What about"guinness"?

719
0:48:21,960 --> 0:48:24,160
I kind of fucking love that.

720
0:48:24,160 --> 0:48:26,330
Except I hate it 'cause you came up with it.

721
0:48:26,330 --> 0:48:27,800
So... ah!

722
0:48:27,800 --> 0:48:29,030
All right, wait, but we could still

723
0:48:29,030 --> 0:48:30,900
name him after the best beer ever.

724
0:48:30,900 --> 0:48:32,070
What about"stout"?

725
0:48:32,070 --> 0:48:33,430
He kind of looks like a stout. Yeah.

726
0:48:33,440 --> 0:48:35,200
You like that, buddy?

727
0:48:35,200 --> 0:48:37,120
You want to be named"stout"?

728
0:48:38,380 --> 0:48:41,110
A-ha-ha."Stout" it is.

729
0:48:41,110 --> 0:48:42,310
I like it. Perfect.

730
0:48:42,310 --> 0:48:44,610
Perfect. Stout. I love it.

731
0:48:44,610 --> 0:48:46,080
Hey, what's this? Hey!

732
0:48:46,080 --> 0:48:47,650
Dude... it's nothing,

733
0:48:47,650 --> 0:48:51,320
I just keep lyrics to songs in it and stuff and just things I like and random thoughts I have.

734
0:48:51,320 --> 0:48:52,590
So it's like a fucking diary.

735
0:48:52,590 --> 0:48:54,320
It's not a fucking diary!

736
0:48:54,320 --> 0:48:56,660
It's just fucking lyrics and...

737
0:48:56,660 --> 0:48:58,230
Random ideas and...

738
0:48:58,230 --> 0:48:59,660
Fucking give it back!

739
0:48:59,660 --> 0:49:01,760
I'll give it back on one condition:

740
0:49:01,760 --> 0:49:04,980
You read me something written by you and not another band.

741
0:49:08,140 --> 0:49:09,650
It's either that or you never get it back.

742
0:49:10,440 --> 0:49:12,340
All right, all right, just give it here.

743
0:49:12,340 --> 0:49:13,440
You have to promise.

744
0:49:15,410 --> 0:49:17,280
You have to say it.

745
0:49:17,280 --> 0:49:19,210
I thought you didn't like promises.

746
0:49:19,220 --> 0:49:20,380
So?

747
0:49:23,350 --> 0:49:24,620
All right, I promise.

748
0:49:30,760 --> 0:49:32,460
But, like...

749
0:49:32,460 --> 0:49:34,240
You got to realize that...

750
0:49:35,600 --> 0:49:37,470
I hear this to really loud music,

751
0:49:37,470 --> 0:49:38,970
and like...

752
0:49:40,470 --> 0:49:41,560
You know what?

753
0:49:41,910 --> 0:49:43,180
Here, let me see that.

754
0:49:45,810 --> 0:49:47,240
Just...

755
0:49:47,240 --> 0:49:49,240
In my head, it's mostly screaming.

756
0:49:55,650 --> 0:49:57,490
All right, you ready?

757
0:49:57,490 --> 0:49:58,490
Yeah, go ahead.

758
0:50:01,120 --> 0:50:02,260
"My entire life,

759
0:50:02,260 --> 0:50:07,230
people try to rattle my cage to force me to explode from the inside out.

760
0:50:07,230 --> 0:50:08,430
Testing me.

761
0:50:08,430 --> 0:50:10,700
Trying to find my breaking point.

762
0:50:10,700 --> 0:50:13,840
My mother would say, 'son, step in from the cold, '

763
0:50:13,840 --> 0:50:16,570
and my father just the same.

764
0:50:16,570 --> 0:50:17,840
He'd say, 'don't ever lose

765
0:50:17,840 --> 0:50:19,640
your self-control.'

766
0:50:20,140 --> 0:50:21,440
but I opened the window.

767
0:50:21,680 --> 0:50:24,150
I let the cold air flow.

768
0:50:24,150 --> 0:50:25,780
I lost my self-control."

769
0:50:35,390 --> 0:50:37,320
Cody cates lived an honest life.

770
0:50:38,630 --> 0:50:41,280
Went to church every sunday.

771
0:50:41,630 --> 0:50:43,080
Played football.

772
0:50:43,600 --> 0:50:47,770
He also was involved in many other extra curricular activities:

773
0:50:47,770 --> 0:50:49,670
National honors society,

774
0:50:49,670 --> 0:50:51,110
student council,

775
0:50:51,110 --> 0:50:53,370
fellowship of christian athletes.

776
0:50:53,380 --> 0:50:54,780
His family

777
0:50:54,780 --> 0:50:59,380
have always been proactive in the community.

778
0:51:00,120 --> 0:51:04,290
Is this what they deserve?

779
0:51:05,650 --> 0:51:07,680
They didn't ask for any of this to happen.

780
0:51:08,660 --> 0:51:13,360
So is this what they really deserve?

781
0:52:11,250 --> 0:52:14,260
Like, what are your plans now that the cheer season's over?

782
0:52:14,260 --> 0:52:16,190
Cheer season doesn't end with football.

783
0:52:16,190 --> 0:52:18,230
There are other sports. Yeah.

784
0:52:18,230 --> 0:52:20,230
Yeah, I mean, like...

785
0:52:20,230 --> 0:52:22,300
I meant, like, are you bummed now that the...

786
0:52:22,300 --> 0:52:23,630
The football season's over?

787
0:52:23,630 --> 0:52:24,800
Honestly, it's kind of exhausting.

788
0:52:24,800 --> 0:52:28,600
You know, all the pep rallies and stupid sign making and stuff.

789
0:52:28,610 --> 0:52:30,900
Hey, this party's getting a little out of control.

790
0:52:30,910 --> 0:52:32,410
Do you guys think the cops will come?

791
0:52:32,410 --> 0:52:33,940
No, don't worry about it, I told you,

792
0:52:33,940 --> 0:52:35,510
cops never come.

793
0:52:35,510 --> 0:52:36,680
Yeah, I mean, cops?

794
0:52:36,680 --> 0:52:37,880
Are you kidding me?

795
0:52:37,880 --> 0:52:39,850
Yo, we run this town.

796
0:52:41,250 --> 0:52:42,250
Run this town,

797
0:52:42,250 --> 0:52:44,320
bitches! Ooh-hoo!

798
0:52:47,520 --> 0:52:50,590
Oh, shit, man!

799
0:52:51,960 --> 0:52:53,960
How you doing? Good.

800
0:52:53,960 --> 0:52:56,660
How you doing? Oh, shit! I almost forgot to show you all

801
0:52:56,670 --> 0:52:58,670
my latest and greatest.

802
0:52:58,670 --> 0:53:01,570
If, um... you'd all please accompany me to my ride.

803
0:53:01,570 --> 0:53:02,870
Okay.

804
0:53:05,410 --> 0:53:06,740
Ricky.

805
0:53:08,380 --> 0:53:09,810
Got to be more like him, you know?

806
0:53:11,280 --> 0:53:13,430
I... this

807
0:53:13,850 --> 0:53:14,880
this is the greatest invention

808
0:53:14,880 --> 0:53:18,360
since goddamn... coke.

809
0:53:20,260 --> 0:53:22,620
Vicks... come on.

810
0:53:22,630 --> 0:53:23,990
Step on up here. Are you shit-faced, man?

811
0:53:23,990 --> 0:53:25,960
I'm cates, baby. Come on! Cates.

812
0:53:25,960 --> 0:53:27,760
Fuck, I'm drunker than a skunk.

813
0:53:27,760 --> 0:53:29,430
Get up there, motherfucker. Come on.

814
0:53:29,430 --> 0:53:31,270
Come on, put your mouth up on that thing.

815
0:53:31,270 --> 0:53:32,730
No, man, what the hell is this thing,

816
0:53:32,740 --> 0:53:33,900
you crazy-ass redneck? Quit...

817
0:53:33,900 --> 0:53:35,640
Being such a goddamn puss.

818
0:53:35,640 --> 0:53:37,040
Just...

819
0:53:37,040 --> 0:53:38,810
Put your mouth on the fucking thing.

820
0:53:38,810 --> 0:53:39,810
All right, I'm going.

821
0:53:39,810 --> 0:53:41,710
Yeah?

822
0:53:41,710 --> 0:53:43,950
You're ruining my goddamn presentation.

823
0:53:48,350 --> 0:53:49,750
All right.

824
0:53:58,690 --> 0:54:01,060
Ooh, god!

825
0:54:01,060 --> 0:54:03,600
Man, what the hell? Is that fucking whiskey?

826
0:54:03,600 --> 0:54:05,600
Goddamn right it's whiskey!

827
0:54:05,600 --> 0:54:11,470
I mean, that is the best fucking shit in the goddamn world whiskey, okay?

828
0:54:11,470 --> 0:54:15,340
It's not cheap, it's fucking expensive stuff so be goddamn appreciative, okay?

829
0:54:15,340 --> 0:54:20,880
Now, see, I rigged the windshield wiper to flow whiskey straight into your fucking mouth.

830
0:54:20,880 --> 0:54:23,380
And you're so unappreciative, you little cock sucker.

831
0:54:26,820 --> 0:54:28,560
Davis, get your ass on up here.

832
0:54:28,560 --> 0:54:29,790
No, no, bro, I'm good. No, yeah, come on.

833
0:54:29,790 --> 0:54:31,430
No, screw you, dawg.

834
0:54:31,430 --> 0:54:32,930
No, your football career just ended.

835
0:54:32,930 --> 0:54:34,460
You're officially retired, all washed up.

836
0:54:34,460 --> 0:54:35,700
Come on, man. Cates!

837
0:54:35,700 --> 0:54:37,470
Drop your cock, and put on your sock.

838
0:54:37,470 --> 0:54:39,070
Enjoy the fucking whiskey, please?

839
0:54:39,070 --> 0:54:40,400
Thank you.

840
0:54:51,950 --> 0:54:53,880
Hey, how's it feel?

841
0:54:53,880 --> 0:54:55,420
Like shit. We're not alone.

842
0:55:11,570 --> 0:55:12,730
All right, y'all, time to break it up.

843
0:55:12,740 --> 0:55:14,370
Come on.

844
0:55:14,370 --> 0:55:15,640
Party's over.

845
0:55:15,640 --> 0:55:16,670
Get home safe.

846
0:55:19,780 --> 0:55:21,070
Yo, ricky.

847
0:55:21,080 --> 0:55:22,080
Yeah? Where y'all headed?

848
0:55:22,080 --> 0:55:23,080
Yeah, buddy.

849
0:55:23,080 --> 0:55:24,150
Thank you.

850
0:55:24,150 --> 0:55:26,510
Tell the kids I said hi.

851
0:55:26,520 --> 0:55:28,620
Much obliged, y'all.

852
0:55:30,450 --> 0:55:33,420
Hey, cody, can we give lindsey a ride home?

853
0:55:33,420 --> 0:55:34,420
Uh, hell yeah we can.

854
0:55:34,420 --> 0:55:35,690
Thanks.

855
0:55:40,960 --> 0:55:42,160
All right.

856
0:55:42,170 --> 0:55:43,630
Let's get the fuck out of here.

857
0:55:52,410 --> 0:55:53,810
Thanks again, guys, I appreciate it.

858
0:55:55,080 --> 0:55:56,080
All right, y'all be safe.

859
0:56:06,920 --> 0:56:08,760
Hurry the fuck up, ricky!

860
0:56:08,760 --> 0:56:10,160
Oh, my god.

861
0:56:10,160 --> 0:56:11,930
Oh, shit.

862
0:56:11,930 --> 0:56:13,090
Damn.

863
0:56:43,830 --> 0:56:45,960
What the fuck, man?

864
0:57:12,760 --> 0:57:14,660
Oh, you fucking bitch!

865
0:57:18,830 --> 0:57:21,260
Ugh! You motherfucker!

866
0:57:21,260 --> 0:57:23,860
Fuck you, pussy! Fuck!

867
0:57:23,870 --> 0:57:27,100
Fucking bitch-ass fucker.

868
0:57:40,650 --> 0:57:42,980
We were minding our own business.

869
0:57:42,990 --> 0:57:44,720
Okay?

870
0:57:46,150 --> 0:57:47,960
It was an all-out ambush.

871
0:58:14,950 --> 0:58:16,850
Welcome to the party, my man. How you fucking bitches doing?

872
0:58:18,290 --> 0:58:19,960
Yeah, we're getting fucked up.

873
0:58:40,040 --> 0:58:42,280
Look at this dumb piece of shit.

874
0:58:42,280 --> 0:58:44,050
Which one of you motherfuckers broke my window?

875
0:58:45,650 --> 0:58:46,750
Excuse me, faggot?

876
0:58:46,750 --> 0:58:47,850
I said,

877
0:58:47,850 --> 0:58:48,850
which on of you motherfuckers

878
0:58:48,850 --> 0:58:50,280
broke my fucking window?

879
0:58:50,290 --> 0:58:53,320
Do you kiss your boyfriend with that fucking mouth?

880
0:58:57,030 --> 0:58:58,630
Get him! Get him!

881
0:58:58,630 --> 0:58:59,990
Get that motherfucker!

882
0:59:01,860 --> 0:59:03,160
Get that motherfucker!

883
0:59:03,170 --> 0:59:04,970
Get him!

884
0:59:04,970 --> 0:59:07,100
Get him! Get off me!

885
0:59:17,710 --> 0:59:19,850
Settle down, settle down.

886
0:59:19,850 --> 0:59:22,050
Come on, motherfucker.

887
0:59:24,320 --> 0:59:25,320
Get up. Come on, boy.

888
0:59:25,320 --> 0:59:27,250
Get off me, man.

889
0:59:27,260 --> 0:59:28,620
Now listen,

890
0:59:28,630 --> 0:59:29,760
I'd admire your spirit,

891
0:59:29,760 --> 0:59:31,060
I really do.

892
0:59:31,060 --> 0:59:32,690
But you done... fucked...

893
0:59:32,690 --> 0:59:33,890
Up...

894
0:59:33,900 --> 0:59:35,400
Real... fucking...

895
0:59:35,400 --> 0:59:37,830
Bad! Huh?

896
0:59:40,170 --> 0:59:42,170
Hey. Hey, you...

897
0:59:43,210 --> 0:59:44,270
Bitch!

898
0:59:46,840 --> 0:59:49,280
Sorry I dropped my fucking chain on your face.

899
0:59:49,280 --> 0:59:51,210
Get him!

900
0:59:52,350 --> 0:59:54,110
Get the fuck off me, man!

901
0:59:54,120 --> 0:59:55,880
Get the fuck off me!

902
0:59:55,880 --> 0:59:59,020
Get the fuck off me!

903
0:59:59,020 --> 1:00:00,020
Get up!

904
1:00:10,070 --> 1:00:11,810
I will not stop

905
1:00:12,200 --> 1:00:18,270
till every last one of you motherfuckers is six feet the fuck under!

906
1:00:22,340 --> 1:00:23,910
Wrath is on, motherfuckers!

907
1:00:25,310 --> 1:00:27,010
Y'all better pray!

908
1:00:37,390 --> 1:00:38,830
Fuck!

909
1:01:23,170 --> 1:01:25,070
Listen to me,

910
1:01:25,070 --> 1:01:27,410
I know he can't hear us.

911
1:02:11,250 --> 1:02:13,850
Damn. What the fuck, y'all?

912
1:02:13,860 --> 1:02:15,490
What the fuck?

913
1:02:19,190 --> 1:02:20,560
Isn't that one of yours?

914
1:02:20,560 --> 1:02:23,300
Looks like it went way past words.

915
1:02:23,300 --> 1:02:24,870
Fuck this, dude, we need to handle shit.

916
1:02:27,240 --> 1:02:29,100
Come on, dude.

917
1:02:29,110 --> 1:02:31,270
Let me see stout. I don't want any glass to get in his paws.

918
1:02:34,280 --> 1:02:35,340
I'm gonna set up, like, a little...

919
1:02:35,340 --> 1:02:37,510
House for him. Aw.

920
1:02:37,510 --> 1:02:40,250
I'll make him a brewery.

921
1:02:42,350 --> 1:02:44,880
Stout's brewery.

922
1:02:44,890 --> 1:02:47,090
Damn, this fucker's heavy.

923
1:02:48,290 --> 1:02:49,790
One, two, three.

924
1:02:52,430 --> 1:02:54,030
There we go.

925
1:02:55,430 --> 1:02:57,200
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

926
1:02:57,200 --> 1:02:58,300
Okay.

927
1:02:58,300 --> 1:03:00,170
Be careful. Okay.

928
1:03:00,170 --> 1:03:01,870
Hey, buddy.

929
1:03:01,870 --> 1:03:03,900
Aw. Hey, buddy.

930
1:03:03,910 --> 1:03:05,480
Here, let me get him some food.

931
1:03:08,910 --> 1:03:10,280
You okay?

932
1:03:10,880 --> 1:03:12,210
You like your new house?

933
1:03:18,190 --> 1:03:19,620
Hungry?

934
1:03:19,620 --> 1:03:21,320
You hungry, buddy?

935
1:03:22,860 --> 1:03:25,260
This is fucking bullshit.

936
1:03:35,070 --> 1:03:37,070
Yo, help me patch this up real quick.

937
1:03:38,610 --> 1:03:40,940
Might be some nails lying all around.

938
1:03:51,890 --> 1:03:54,160
You got it? Yeah, yeah, I got it.

939
1:03:59,000 --> 1:04:00,660
Let me get the other side.

940
1:04:00,660 --> 1:04:02,130
Hold it up.

941
1:04:02,130 --> 1:04:04,360
I'm holding it, dawg. The fuck?

942
1:04:14,440 --> 1:04:16,010
No, just leave it. It's good.

943
1:04:18,010 --> 1:04:20,210
Yo, where's the car at?

944
1:04:20,220 --> 1:04:23,050
Oh, what the fuck happened to your face, bro? Holy shit.

945
1:04:23,050 --> 1:04:24,060
John...

946
1:04:24,670 --> 1:04:25,910
King! King!

947
1:04:26,320 --> 1:04:28,460
What the fuck, dude?

948
1:04:29,490 --> 1:04:30,490
Dude!

949
1:04:30,490 --> 1:04:33,100
What the fuck happened, man?

950
1:04:35,430 --> 1:04:36,430
It's all right, dude.

951
1:04:37,020 --> 1:04:38,220
You can tell me.

952
1:04:43,470 --> 1:04:45,440
I've had enough, man.

953
1:04:48,280 --> 1:04:49,660
I'm tired.

954
1:04:52,620 --> 1:04:53,730
I'm tired of...

955
1:04:56,280 --> 1:04:58,010
Sitting around and...

956
1:04:58,260 --> 1:05:01,530
Letting them act like we don't have a place.

957
1:05:05,280 --> 1:05:10,480
So I went down there to show them that we aren't gonna sit around and take anymore of their shit.

958
1:05:23,980 --> 1:05:27,050
Let's even the motherfucking odds.

959
1:05:27,050 --> 1:05:29,000
I got a bad fucking feeling about this, man.

960
1:05:29,030 --> 1:05:30,360
Shut the fuck up.

961
1:05:35,060 --> 1:05:37,060
Yo! Shit's gone on too far, man.

962
1:05:37,060 --> 1:05:40,190
That's what I'm saying. You said so yourself,

963
1:05:40,200 --> 1:05:43,560
we have to make a fucking statement. Yeah, dawg.

964
1:05:43,570 --> 1:05:45,700
We can't just sit here and act like everything's gonna blow the fuck over.

965
1:05:45,700 --> 1:05:47,630
It ain't gonna stop either. Next time, it could be you,

966
1:05:47,640 --> 1:05:50,270
me, your girl or any fucking one of us.

967
1:05:51,570 --> 1:05:53,440
I'm going with or without you.

968
1:05:53,440 --> 1:05:54,710
He's right, man.

969
1:05:54,710 --> 1:05:57,140
Shit's gone on way too fucking long.

970
1:05:57,150 --> 1:05:58,580
You don't fucking know, there could be, like, a shitload of them.

971
1:05:58,580 --> 1:06:01,150
Then we fucking equalize it!

972
1:06:01,150 --> 1:06:04,080
Yeah, fucking equalizers. Y'all need to calm the fuck down.

973
1:06:04,090 --> 1:06:05,120
Fuck this.

974
1:06:05,120 --> 1:06:07,620
Brian! What?

975
1:06:07,620 --> 1:06:10,720
Look at this fucking place!

976
1:06:10,730 --> 1:06:12,730
Look at king's fucking face!

977
1:06:14,530 --> 1:06:16,300
Let's fucking do this, yo. Let's go. Crass, come on.

978
1:06:16,300 --> 1:06:18,330
Hey, wait! What?

979
1:06:18,330 --> 1:06:20,340
I'm sorry.

980
1:06:22,340 --> 1:06:24,240
We need to be in this together.

981
1:06:24,240 --> 1:06:25,340
All right? We'll be fine.

982
1:06:25,340 --> 1:06:26,770
Come on.

983
1:06:26,780 --> 1:06:28,570
Let's roll!

984
1:06:28,580 --> 1:06:30,250
Come on, brian!

985
1:06:37,550 --> 1:06:39,420
Let's fucking do this!

986
1:06:39,420 --> 1:06:40,550
Let's go!

987
1:06:40,560 --> 1:06:42,820
Come on, motherfuckers!

988
1:06:44,230 --> 1:06:46,130
Go, go, go, go!

989
1:06:56,300 --> 1:06:58,300
I don't remember.

990
1:06:58,310 --> 1:07:00,720
Events of that night are blank.

991
1:07:01,580 --> 1:07:06,380
Are they blank 'cause you had a couple of drinks to ease your nerves?

992
1:07:23,400 --> 1:07:25,130
I mean, they were everywhere.

993
1:07:25,130 --> 1:07:26,400
They were...

994
1:07:26,400 --> 1:07:28,570
Had weapons, had all kinds of bats.

995
1:07:28,570 --> 1:07:30,470
I mean, we weren't expecting that.

996
1:07:30,470 --> 1:07:32,070
We didn't come for that.

997
1:07:40,580 --> 1:07:42,760
I feel like...

998
1:07:42,790 --> 1:07:44,660
It was all my fault.

999
1:08:28,530 --> 1:08:30,900
Fuckers, come on!

1000
1:08:30,900 --> 1:08:35,570
You know, it's a fucking pain in the ass every two weeks to have to beat one of these fuckers down.

1001
1:08:35,570 --> 1:08:38,570
Right? Am I fucking right?

1002
1:08:52,960 --> 1:08:56,490
The stuff I recall is pretty hard to forget.

1003
1:08:59,530 --> 1:09:01,230
And at that point,

1004
1:09:01,230 --> 1:09:04,130
it had been a while since I had anything to drink.

1005
1:09:04,770 --> 1:09:06,240
Bye! Bye.

1006
1:09:06,670 --> 1:09:08,640
It's good seeing you. Have a good one.

1007
1:09:13,680 --> 1:09:15,510
Yo, let's get up there.

1008
1:09:15,510 --> 1:09:18,210
Ricky keeps blowing me up.

1009
1:09:48,580 --> 1:09:49,910
These fights never would materialize.

1010
1:09:51,610 --> 1:09:54,780
One side would show up and everyone would gather in the parking lot

1011
1:09:54,780 --> 1:09:57,320
like a big, fun social event.

1012
1:09:58,690 --> 1:10:00,820
That's what I thought was going to happen.

1013
1:10:06,500 --> 1:10:08,300
But no one was ready for this.

1014
1:10:37,290 --> 1:10:39,760
I wanted to say something, but it was too late.

1015
1:10:43,860 --> 1:10:45,100
I wish...

1016
1:10:48,870 --> 1:10:50,670
It was just too late.

1017
1:11:27,010 --> 1:11:28,640
Fucker, come here!

1018
1:11:28,640 --> 1:11:29,810
Come here!

1019
1:11:29,810 --> 1:11:31,050
Come here, you fuckers!

1020
1:11:46,560 --> 1:11:48,590
It's now or never, motherfuckers!

1021
1:11:48,600 --> 1:11:49,900
We end this shit tonight.

1022
1:12:00,480 --> 1:12:02,440
Come here. Come here, motherfucker

1023
1:12:02,440 --> 1:12:03,750
come on.

1024
1:12:23,430 --> 1:12:25,660
Yo, what the fuck is going on? Yeah, let's just get out of here.

1025
1:12:25,670 --> 1:12:27,930
Fuck! Davis, davis, can we please get out of here?

1026
1:12:27,940 --> 1:12:29,800
Yo, just shut the fuck up, all right?

1027
1:12:29,810 --> 1:12:31,970
Let me think! No, fuck that, we need to do something.

1028
1:12:31,970 --> 1:12:33,470
We're fucked up! Wait!

1029
1:12:36,550 --> 1:12:40,110
I'm a ninja in my caddy.

1030
1:12:40,110 --> 1:12:43,720
Wait, cody, stop this! Stop it, we need to get out of here!

1031
1:12:43,720 --> 1:12:46,020
Shut up, no. Please, can we just get out of here?

1032
1:12:47,720 --> 1:12:49,520
Oh, my god! Oh!

1033
1:12:51,090 --> 1:12:52,590
Oh, my gosh, what...

1034
1:12:52,590 --> 1:12:54,130
Fuck! What are you doing?

1035
1:12:54,130 --> 1:12:56,130
Stop it, man, let me out of this fucking car!

1036
1:12:56,130 --> 1:12:57,560
Holy shit! All right!

1037
1:12:57,570 --> 1:12:58,570
No, we're fucking going.

1038
1:13:17,220 --> 1:13:19,550
Get the fuck out of the way.

1039
1:13:21,690 --> 1:13:23,490
W-what are you doing?

1040
1:13:23,490 --> 1:13:25,030
Get me the fuck out of this car.

1041
1:13:41,780 --> 1:13:42,780
No!

1042
1:13:42,780 --> 1:13:44,010
W-what are you doing?

1043
1:13:44,010 --> 1:13:45,610
Cody, stop this! Stop it,

1044
1:13:45,610 --> 1:13:46,950
we need to get out of here! Stop!

1045
1:13:46,950 --> 1:13:48,480
Oh, my god! No, no, no!

1046
1:13:55,120 --> 1:13:56,620
No, you motherfucker!

1047
1:13:56,630 --> 1:13:59,530
Fuck! Yeah, I bet he liked that one.

1048
1:14:11,870 --> 1:14:13,640
All right, all right.

1049
1:14:13,640 --> 1:14:15,840
It's gonna be all right.

1050
1:14:15,840 --> 1:14:17,840
You're gonna be all right, bro, just stay...

1051
1:14:17,850 --> 1:14:19,250
Stay with me. Call an ambulance!

1052
1:14:19,250 --> 1:14:21,020
Somebody call the fucking ambulance!

1053
1:14:26,760 --> 1:14:27,460
Is he okay?

1054
1:14:29,060 --> 1:14:30,860
He's dead, he's fucking dead!

1055
1:14:30,860 --> 1:14:32,260
Not like this.

1056
1:14:32,260 --> 1:14:35,050
Brian, sit up, cops are coming, man.

1057
1:14:35,300 --> 1:14:37,550
Don't you fucking die.

1058
1:14:38,170 --> 1:14:40,630
Don't you fucking leave me, man!

1059
1:14:40,640 --> 1:14:41,630
Not like this.

1060
1:14:43,170 --> 1:14:44,810
Not like this.

1061
1:15:03,060 --> 1:15:04,660
No!

1062
1:15:22,680 --> 1:15:25,080
What did you do?

1063
1:15:25,080 --> 1:15:27,850
What did you just do? Oh, my god!

1064
1:15:28,980 --> 1:15:31,630
Oh, my god!

1065
1:15:31,990 --> 1:15:33,890
Lord, help me.

1066
1:15:33,890 --> 1:15:35,360
Help me.

1067
1:15:35,360 --> 1:15:37,590
Oh, my god.

1068
1:15:38,290 --> 1:15:40,760
Oh, my god, what if he's dead?

1069
1:15:40,760 --> 1:15:41,760
What if he's dead?

1070
1:15:41,760 --> 1:15:43,060
Michelle!

1071
1:15:43,060 --> 1:15:44,260
Why?

1072
1:15:44,270 --> 1:15:45,970
What if you killed him?

1073
1:15:45,970 --> 1:15:48,170
What are you gonna do?

1074
1:16:13,230 --> 1:16:14,560
No!

1075
1:16:34,750 --> 1:16:37,980
Just... fucking wait, don't look at him.

1076
1:16:37,990 --> 1:16:39,350
Don't fucking look at him.

1077
1:16:46,430 --> 1:16:49,310
Y'all don't have to go down with me, okay?

1078
1:16:49,970 --> 1:16:51,760
I'll, uh...

1079
1:16:51,770 --> 1:16:53,400
I'll tell them that y'all weren't in the car.

1080
1:16:53,400 --> 1:16:54,830
But we were in the car!

1081
1:16:54,840 --> 1:16:56,100
Michelle, I don't think you understand

1082
1:16:56,100 --> 1:16:58,640
how serious this is!

1083
1:17:53,960 --> 1:17:55,730
Fuck!

1084
1:18:00,270 --> 1:18:01,840
Fuck!

1085
1:18:09,010 --> 1:18:10,680
Fuck!

1086
1:18:11,480 --> 1:18:12,750
Fuck!

1087
1:18:14,450 --> 1:18:15,790
Fuck!

1088
1:18:16,320 --> 1:18:17,320
No...

1089
1:18:17,320 --> 1:18:19,490
Not me.

1090
1:18:19,490 --> 1:18:21,360
Oh, god, no, please.

1091
1:18:48,950 --> 1:18:50,010
Mom...

1092
1:18:51,350 --> 1:18:54,180
Mom, you and dad need to come up here.

1093
1:18:54,560 --> 1:18:56,810
Western plaza.

1094
1:18:58,230 --> 1:19:00,060
It's brian, something happened.

1095
1:19:01,700 --> 1:19:03,330
It's bad, ma.

1096
1:19:05,470 --> 1:19:07,470
I don't know.

1097
1:19:07,470 --> 1:19:09,100
Please, just...

1098
1:19:09,100 --> 1:19:10,470
Just come.

1099
1:19:35,060 --> 1:19:36,200
I remember...

1100
1:19:36,200 --> 1:19:40,100
It being so cold.

1101
1:19:40,100 --> 1:19:41,600
Unusually cold.

1102
1:19:48,880 --> 1:19:50,880
And there was glass and metal everywhere.

1103
1:19:50,880 --> 1:19:52,550
It was chaos.

1104
1:19:52,550 --> 1:19:55,950
It... it was worse than any nightmare.

1105
1:20:08,130 --> 1:20:13,230
Cody's thoughts that night lay in intimidation,

1106
1:20:13,240 --> 1:20:14,540
in fear.

1107
1:20:17,000 --> 1:20:19,130
But not hatred.

1108
1:20:19,540 --> 1:20:21,940
Yeah, but what he did is still wrong.

1109
1:20:28,480 --> 1:20:32,410
And you cannot defend what he did.

1110
1:21:43,890 --> 1:21:45,730
Can I have the keys, please?

1111
1:22:23,260 --> 1:22:24,360
Chuck.

1112
1:22:24,370 --> 1:22:26,020
What? What do you got?

1113
1:22:26,380 --> 1:22:31,040
We believe that the evidence will convince you,

1114
1:22:31,230 --> 1:22:33,480
beyond a reasonable doubt, that this was not an accident,

1115
1:22:34,280 --> 1:22:37,950
that this is was not justified, and...

1116
1:22:39,210 --> 1:22:42,950
And that the defendant intentionally...

1117
1:22:42,950 --> 1:22:46,620
And knowingly murdered brian deneke.

1118
1:22:47,840 --> 1:22:50,570
He had never attempted to apply his brakes

1119
1:22:51,830 --> 1:22:53,830
or turn his steering wheel

1120
1:22:53,830 --> 1:22:55,560
as his cadillac had approached brian.

1121
1:22:58,540 --> 1:23:00,810
He had fled the scene of a crime

1122
1:23:01,040 --> 1:23:02,750
and he lied to the police.

1123
1:23:04,650 --> 1:23:06,050
When the medical examiner

1124
1:23:06,080 --> 1:23:07,980
had described brian's injuries,

1125
1:23:08,010 --> 1:23:15,880
he concluded that brian had remained conscious as his body was dragged under the... underneath the wheels of that cadillac.

1126
1:23:17,420 --> 1:23:18,580
The impact...

1127
1:23:19,770 --> 1:23:22,450
Impact so severe,

1128
1:23:23,440 --> 1:23:26,310
that his collarbone had been torn free from his shoulder.

1129
1:24:03,430 --> 1:24:08,540
Our young people... on both sides of the aisle in this community

1130
1:24:09,160 --> 1:24:16,590
need to be told by the 12 of you that what you do carries with it consequence.

1131
1:24:17,720 --> 1:24:19,060
No matter who you are.

1132
1:24:20,470 --> 1:24:22,940
No matter what you look like.

1133
1:24:25,590 --> 1:24:27,220
And no matter how you dress.

1134
1:24:35,400 --> 1:24:37,030
I don't expect

1135
1:24:37,030 --> 1:24:39,430
you to enjoy sending this young man to prison.

1136
1:24:41,250 --> 1:24:42,260
I don't.

1137
1:24:44,570 --> 1:24:49,080
I expect you to do it with a tear in your eye and your heart in your throat.

1138
1:24:52,890 --> 1:24:54,460
President john kennedy said,

1139
1:24:55,520 --> 1:24:56,810
"we do things,

1140
1:24:56,820 --> 1:24:58,380
not because they are easy,

1141
1:24:58,400 --> 1:25:01,110
but because they are hard."

1142
1:25:02,420 --> 1:25:05,660
Today I ask you to do the hard thing.

1143
1:25:05,660 --> 1:25:08,830
I ask you to send a message to this community

1144
1:25:08,830 --> 1:25:11,930
that all young people, all of them,

1145
1:25:12,700 --> 1:25:15,230
will suffer the consequences of their actions,

1146
1:25:15,240 --> 1:25:18,340
and that you are holding cody cates

1147
1:25:18,340 --> 1:25:22,640
unconditionally responsible for the death of brian deneke.

1148
1:26:29,810 --> 1:26:32,750
"Destroy everything."

1149
1:26:34,020 --> 1:26:40,490
Is this the message we want to send our children for generations to come?

1150
1:26:40,490 --> 1:26:44,010
"Destroy... everything."

1151
1:26:45,330 --> 1:26:51,360
Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a case about diversity or tolerance,

1152
1:26:51,370 --> 1:26:57,370
this is not about judging people for the way they dress.

1153
1:26:57,940 --> 1:27:03,500
This case is about a gang of young men who chose

1154
1:27:03,530 --> 1:27:10,640
a lifestyle designed to intimidate those around them, to challenge authority

1155
1:27:10,950 --> 1:27:15,890
and to provoke a reaction from society itself.

1156
1:27:18,030 --> 1:27:24,060
When those punks brought bats and chains out there with them to western street that night,

1157
1:27:24,070 --> 1:27:30,970
a conspiracy was put into play to kill and maim those high school students.

1158
1:27:33,640 --> 1:27:37,610
Cody had no time to think or ponder,

1159
1:27:37,610 --> 1:27:42,050
he had to take immediate action and he took it.

1160
1:27:43,620 --> 1:27:47,350
And if he had to live it all over...

1161
1:27:47,360 --> 1:27:49,090
He would do it again.

1162
1:27:50,620 --> 1:27:55,600
You see, what cody cates faced out there that night

1163
1:27:55,600 --> 1:27:57,700
was a bad combination:

1164
1:27:57,700 --> 1:28:00,530
A mean drunk with a weapon.

1165
1:28:01,390 --> 1:28:02,380
And somewhere,

1166
1:28:02,610 --> 1:28:07,210
in the infinite processes that shape a boy into a man...

1167
1:28:08,400 --> 1:28:10,910
Something happened to brian deneke.

1168
1:28:11,580 --> 1:28:14,950
The manner of his death was, unfortunately,

1169
1:28:14,950 --> 1:28:22,490
the end result of a long list of poor choices over the last six years of his life.

1170
1:28:24,090 --> 1:28:27,990
You could even argue that he was destined to die the way he did.

1171
1:28:29,050 --> 1:28:31,970
He was a violent individual.

1172
1:28:32,450 --> 1:28:36,560
And it took violence on cody cates' part...

1173
1:28:37,670 --> 1:28:44,150
To put an end to further violence and to save an innocent life.

1174
1:28:51,630 --> 1:28:53,230
Let this boy go home.

1175
1:28:55,020 --> 1:28:57,280
Restore him to his family.

1176
1:28:59,530 --> 1:29:01,690
'Cause he did the right thing.

1177
1:31:20,830 --> 1:31:23,740
The one story that, uh...

1178
1:31:23,740 --> 1:31:25,770
That really struck me

1179
1:31:25,770 --> 1:31:29,240
and got me thinking about this was, a few years ago,

1180
1:31:29,240 --> 1:31:35,680
there was this teenage punk rocker kid who was run down by a white jock in dad's cadillac.

1181
1:31:35,680 --> 1:31:41,390
And, uh... this boy died because he looked different.

1182
1:31:41,390 --> 1:31:44,290
So this thing happens, this guy kills this kid,

1183
1:31:44,290 --> 1:31:46,860
and is clearly guilty,

1184
1:31:46,860 --> 1:31:48,930
you know, his guilt is admitted,

1185
1:31:48,930 --> 1:31:51,900
and guess where this all-american athlete is,

1186
1:31:51,900 --> 1:31:53,830
he's in college.

1187
1:31:53,830 --> 1:31:57,540
You know, the jury felt the punk rocker deserved to die

1188
1:31:57,540 --> 1:31:59,510
because he looked the way he did.

1189
1:31:59,510 --> 1:32:02,710
And not only was he killed, but then, in the trial,

1190
1:32:02,710 --> 1:32:05,610
he was killed again because they...

1191
1:32:05,610 --> 1:32:07,480
You know, criticized his lifestyle

1192
1:32:07,480 --> 1:32:11,380
because he didn't, you know, wear a tommy hilfiger shirt

1193
1:32:11,390 --> 1:32:13,720
and khaki pants, you know?

1194
1:32:13,720 --> 1:32:17,620
And then the killer was even applauded at graduation

1195
1:32:17,620 --> 1:32:19,290
because he was a football star.

1196
1:32:19,290 --> 1:32:20,290
The american dream,

1197
1:32:20,290 --> 1:32:22,730
strong, normal.

1198
1:32:22,730 --> 1:32:24,900
He never a spent a day in prison.

1199
1:32:24,900 --> 1:32:26,400
So who do we blame?

1200
1:32:26,400 --> 1:32:27,730
You know?

1201
1:32:27,740 --> 1:32:29,700
Everybody wants to say, you know,

1202
1:32:29,700 --> 1:32:32,240
"too much violence, too much violence today,"

1203
1:32:32,240 --> 1:32:33,610
you know?

1204
1:32:35,780 --> 1:32:37,340
Did everyone forget about the civil war,

1205
1:32:37,350 --> 1:32:38,880
or the bible, or shakespeare, you know?

1206
1:32:38,880 --> 1:32:41,950
Violence isn't brand-new.

1207
1:32:41,950 --> 1:32:43,720
That's why I asked the question, you know?

1208
1:32:43,720 --> 1:32:46,250
I put this up on my website.

1209
1:32:46,250 --> 1:32:49,490
I said,"is adult entertainment killing our children,

1210
1:32:49,490 --> 1:32:52,630
or is killing our children entertaining adults?"

1211
1:32:52,630 --> 1:32:54,330
I think that's kind of the question

1212
1:32:54,330 --> 1:32:56,560
we got to ask ourselves today.

1213
1:32:56,560 --> 1:33:01,930
And, yes, ask yourself that every time you watch the hungry cameras at the crime scene,

1214
1:33:01,940 --> 1:33:05,740
or at the funeral, or at the plane crash.

1215
1:33:05,740 --> 1:33:07,610
You know, I'm in a square right now. You're looking at me,

1216
1:33:07,610 --> 1:33:09,980
I'm looking at myself in a monitor, you know?

1217
1:33:09,980 --> 1:33:14,710
We sit in front of the tv and we are the tv.

1218
1:33:14,720 --> 1:33:17,380
We're a copy staring at a copy...

1219
1:33:17,380 --> 1:33:19,390
At a copy and a copy.

1220
1:33:19,390 --> 1:33:23,660
Eventually it's a xerox that's so degenerated,

1221
1:33:23,660 --> 1:33:26,690
we don't know which came first.

1222
1:33:26,690 --> 1:33:28,330
And that's where we are.

1223
1:33:28,330 --> 1:33:30,000
And that's what I'd like to leave you with.

1224
1:33:30,490 --> 1:33:38,440
美国历史上 最大的城市艺术项目

1225
1:33:40,780 --> 1:33:46,160
美国历史上 最大的城市艺术项目

1226
1:33:48,510 --> 1:34:01,460
仍旧在德州阿马里洛社区内

1227
1:34:27,360 --> 1:34:28,520
Don't tell me what to do,

1228
1:34:28,520 --> 1:34:30,090
I'm a fucking anarchist!
