1
0:00:08,970 --> 0:00:11,650
Have you considered, John?

2
0:00:11,650 --> 0:00:13,010
Aye.

3
0:00:14,890 --> 0:00:16,330
Your answer?

4
0:00:19,810 --> 0:00:20,930
No.

5
0:00:22,050 --> 0:00:24,370
Why, pray?

6
0:00:24,370 --> 0:00:27,890
You would have me sit as a judge at the King's trial.

7
0:00:27,890 --> 0:00:29,650
Others have already agreed.

8
0:00:32,530 --> 0:00:34,850
By whose authority will he be tried?

9
0:00:34,850 --> 0:00:36,050
By that of Parliament.

10
0:00:36,050 --> 0:00:37,450
Oliver!

11
0:00:37,450 --> 0:00:40,610
This is your Parliament, since you purged it.

12
0:00:40,610 --> 0:00:43,170
Is that not the truth?

13
0:00:43,170 --> 0:00:46,130
Aye, sir, for you are Honest John Lilburne.

14
0:00:46,130 --> 0:00:48,130
Let a new Parliament be freely elected,

15
0:00:48,130 --> 0:00:50,170
let that Parliament call for the King...

16
0:00:50,170 --> 0:00:51,930
We waste our breath together, sir.

17
0:00:51,930 --> 0:00:53,070
Then answer me this one thing

18
0:00:53,470 --> 0:00:56,320
if it happen that Charles Stuart be found innocent of the crime

19
0:00:56,320 --> 0:00:57,610
of making war on his people,

20
0:00:58,290 --> 0:00:59,890
will you let him be set free?

21
0:01:04,330 --> 0:01:06,610
England will be never be at peace

22
0:01:06,610 --> 0:01:10,090
till this matter of the King be settled once for all.

23
0:01:10,840 --> 0:01:12,260
Fare you well.

24
0:01:13,220 --> 0:01:15,910
Newgate Prison London

25
0:01:17,050 --> 0:01:19,410
Just one more time.

26
0:01:19,410 --> 0:01:23,050
You're nearly there. Again. And breath and push...

27
0:01:23,050 --> 0:01:26,490
Hard, hard! Push, Angelica, push!

28
0:01:28,490 --> 0:01:30,850
Yes, yes!

29
0:02:10,840 --> 0:02:15,760
翻译：Tpring 奈利 多切 麦麦

30
0:02:26,050 --> 0:02:29,930
The court commands the charge be read.

31
0:02:29,930 --> 0:02:35,570
My Lord, in behalf of the Commons of England

32
0:02:35,570 --> 0:02:37,490
and of all the people thereof...

33
0:02:37,490 --> 0:02:38,490
Hold a little.

34
0:02:47,050 --> 0:02:49,770
In behalf of the Commons of England

35
0:02:49,770 --> 0:02:51,830
and of all the people thereof,

36
0:02:51,930 --> 0:02:56,790
I do accuse Charles Stuart, here present,

37
0:02:56,790 --> 0:02:59,970
as a tyrant, traitor and murderer,

38
0:02:59,970 --> 0:03:04,850
public and implacable enemy to the Commonwealth of England

39
0:03:04,850 --> 0:03:06,170
and man of blood!

40
0:03:10,050 --> 0:03:14,130
God save the King! God save the King!

41
0:03:14,130 --> 0:03:16,890
God save the King!

42
0:03:16,890 --> 0:03:19,530
Sir, we would have your answer.

43
0:03:19,530 --> 0:03:22,340
I would know by what lawful authority I am called hither.

44
0:03:22,340 --> 0:03:24,340
Remember, I am your King.

45
0:03:24,340 --> 0:03:26,430
We are satisfied of our own authority.

46
0:03:26,430 --> 0:03:30,430
It is not your self-satisfaction that should decide the matter.

47
0:03:30,880 --> 0:03:33,210
I know as much law as any one of you.

48
0:03:33,210 --> 0:03:37,250
Show me one precedent in history for these proceedings.

49
0:03:37,810 --> 0:03:40,330
It is not for a prisoner to require.

50
0:03:40,840 --> 0:03:44,580
Sir, I am not an ordinary prisoner.

51
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:49,680
Make them be quiet!

52
0:03:49,680 --> 0:03:52,520
Clear the court!

53
0:03:57,160 --> 0:04:00,640
A boy. He came too early into the world - no air in his lungs.

54
0:04:30,000 --> 0:04:31,880
Now the law can hang me.

55
0:04:32,840 --> 0:04:36,240
Ask Elizabeth to fetch me my wedding dress

56
0:04:36,240 --> 0:04:39,160
and then you can go home, Saxby.

57
0:04:42,630 --> 0:04:44,950
I have no home, if you be hanged.

58
0:04:44,950 --> 0:04:46,870
Then wander the world,

59
0:04:46,870 --> 0:04:49,150
for hanged I must be.

60
0:04:50,710 --> 0:04:52,390
You're guilty!

61
0:04:52,390 --> 0:04:53,550
Murderer!

62
0:04:59,630 --> 0:05:03,670
King of Blood! There's blood on your hands!

63
0:05:07,890 --> 0:05:10,110
In the name of the people of England...

64
0:05:10,340 --> 0:05:13,460
Not a half! Not a quarter of the people of England!

65
0:05:13,490 --> 0:05:15,420
Oliver Cromwell is a traitor!

66
0:05:15,420 --> 0:05:18,490
Oliver Cromwell is a traitor!        Away!

67
0:05:18,490 --> 0:05:21,810
The prisoner, having refused to give his answer to the charges

68
0:05:21,810 --> 0:05:24,890
has thereby confessed his guilt.

69
0:05:24,920 --> 0:05:26,660
The prisoner may speak.

70
0:05:32,020 --> 0:05:33,580
I must tell you all...

71
0:05:36,380 --> 0:05:39,700
..this many a day, all things have been taken away from me...

72
0:05:42,140 --> 0:05:46,160
..but that which I call more dear to me than my life...

73
0:05:47,980 --> 0:05:50,940
..my conscience

74
0:05:50,940 --> 0:05:52,380
and my honour.

75
0:05:55,100 --> 0:05:57,420
If I had more respect to my life

76
0:05:57,420 --> 0:05:59,300
than the peace of the kingdom...

77
0:06:00,380 --> 0:06:02,620
..I should've made a defence for myself

78
0:06:02,620 --> 0:06:06,380
that might leastwise have delayed the ugly sentence

79
0:06:06,380 --> 0:06:09,590
which I believe you will pass on me.

80
0:06:12,700 --> 0:06:15,340
I know it is in vain to dispute with you.

81
0:06:19,100 --> 0:06:21,940
I cannot deny the power you have.

82
0:06:27,780 --> 0:06:30,420
I have nothing more to say.

83
0:06:35,340 --> 0:06:41,830
Sir, there is a bond made between a king and his people.

84
0:06:42,020 --> 0:06:46,860
A bond of protection due from the sovereign

85
0:06:46,860 --> 0:06:50,490
and subjection due from the people.

86
0:06:52,180 --> 0:06:55,900
When this bond is once broken...

87
0:06:57,140 --> 0:06:59,750
..farewell sovereignty.

88
0:07:02,540 --> 0:07:06,680
Charles Stuart, as a tyrant, traitor,

89
0:07:06,680 --> 0:07:09,940
murderer and a public enemy,

90
0:07:09,940 --> 0:07:12,180
shall be put to death

91
0:07:12,180 --> 0:07:15,740
by the severing of his head from his body.

92
0:07:24,540 --> 0:07:26,060
Why is it so still?

93
0:07:27,500 --> 0:07:29,860
They kill the King today.

94
0:07:49,980 --> 0:07:53,410
Where are your friends today, madam?

95
0:07:53,620 --> 0:07:55,400
Here before me, sirrah

96
0:07:55,400 --> 0:07:58,360
ready to pull at my legs and hasten my death.

97
0:08:00,460 --> 0:08:02,060
Where's the hangman?

98
0:08:06,020 --> 0:08:11,350
Elizabeth, tell your mother when you see her

99
0:08:11,350 --> 0:08:15,730
that my thoughts have never strayed from her,

100
0:08:16,810 --> 0:08:20,560
that my love will be the same to the last. Will you tell her?

101
0:08:24,480 --> 0:08:26,520
Sweetheart, I fear you will forget this.

102
0:08:26,520 --> 0:08:30,960
I shall never forget it whilst I live.

103
0:08:34,080 --> 0:08:35,800
Child...

104
0:08:39,520 --> 0:08:41,990
..they will cut off my head...

105
0:08:42,750 --> 0:08:46,750
..and perhaps make you a King.

106
0:08:47,650 --> 0:08:49,850
But mark what I say...

107
0:08:51,450 --> 0:08:56,770
You must not be a king so long as your brothers do live.

108
0:08:56,770 --> 0:08:59,650
I'll be torn in pieces first.

109
0:09:33,650 --> 0:09:35,450
It is very low.

110
0:09:35,450 --> 0:09:38,530
It can be no higher, sir.

111
0:09:54,130 --> 0:09:55,570
Remember.

112
0:10:55,250 --> 0:10:59,290
You die a thief, a murderess and a whore.

113
0:10:59,290 --> 0:11:02,650
Will you at last admit your guilt and beg forgiveness?

114
0:11:02,650 --> 0:11:05,900
I will beg nothing from you,

115
0:11:06,370 --> 0:11:07,810
nor any man.

116
0:11:09,570 --> 0:11:12,250
Men have accused me,

117
0:11:12,250 --> 0:11:13,810
men have judged me...

118
0:11:15,410 --> 0:11:17,330
..and now men will kill me.

119
0:11:18,410 --> 0:11:21,490
Men have sought to silence me all my days.

120
0:11:23,090 --> 0:11:26,170
But, before I am cut off, hear me.

121
0:11:26,170 --> 0:11:30,730
You're the thief, sir, for that you've stolen this world.

122
0:11:30,730 --> 0:11:34,370
You're the murderer, for that you've killed its dreams.

123
0:11:34,370 --> 0:11:38,410
And you, sir, are the whore,

124
0:11:38,630 --> 0:11:42,730
for you sold your soul for a bag of gold.

125
0:11:46,690 --> 0:11:48,330
Very pretty gallows speech.

126
0:11:48,330 --> 0:11:49,770
Where is the hangman?

127
0:11:54,090 --> 0:11:55,240
Make haste, sir

128
0:11:55,240 --> 0:11:57,360
my master has bought a window at Whitehall.

129
0:12:02,330 --> 0:12:04,770
On another day,

130
0:12:04,770 --> 0:12:06,930
I could have wished her your slowest death.

131
0:12:06,930 --> 0:12:09,090
Hangman, I forgive you.

132
0:12:09,090 --> 0:12:10,930
But today,

133
0:12:10,930 --> 0:12:12,890
hurry, sir.

134
0:12:20,950 --> 0:12:22,410
No more words, madam?

135
0:12:22,410 --> 0:12:26,490
Where is Colonel Rainsborough today, hmm?

136
0:12:27,900 --> 0:12:29,230
What?

137
0:12:29,690 --> 0:12:31,500
You cannot speak?

138
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:39,850
Are her ankles not pretty?

139
0:12:39,850 --> 0:12:40,850
Let me pull on her legs!

140
0:12:40,850 --> 0:12:41,930
No.

141
0:12:41,930 --> 0:12:43,570
For pity's sake!

142
0:12:43,570 --> 0:12:46,130
We lose time, sir.

143
0:12:46,160 --> 0:12:50,050
Hangman, do not bring her down until she be dead.

144
0:12:50,050 --> 0:12:52,690
We must leave now, sir.

145
0:12:52,690 --> 0:12:53,930
On, sir.

146
0:13:21,730 --> 0:13:23,210
Edward!

147
0:13:26,650 --> 0:13:29,170
Stay for the sign.

148
0:14:01,850 --> 0:14:04,010
Breathe!

149
0:14:25,730 --> 0:14:28,410
Order! Stand back!

150
0:14:50,940 --> 0:14:54,260
You should scares spesk to Cramwel about everything now,

151
0:14:54,490 --> 0:14:57,090
but he will lay his hand upon his breast.

152
0:14:57,650 --> 0:15:02,030
Aye and he'll elevate his eyes. He'll call God to record.

153
0:15:02,500 --> 0:15:05,170
He will weep, he will howl, he will repent.

154
0:15:05,170 --> 0:15:07,810
Even while he doth smite you under the fifth rib!

155
0:15:10,610 --> 0:15:13,920
Comrades, what did the army fight for, eh?

156
0:15:14,690 --> 0:15:19,150
To make Oliver absolute lord and ruler over Ireland...

157
0:15:19,150 --> 0:15:21,650
..As he is now, over England.

158
0:15:21,690 --> 0:15:26,920
England's new chains, England's new chains!

159
0:15:26,920 --> 0:15:28,390
Read it and weep!

160
0:15:35,080 --> 0:15:36,810
Gentlemen.

161
0:15:41,750 --> 0:15:43,670
Edward.

162
0:15:43,670 --> 0:15:47,710
The republic fights for its first breaths while Honest John

163
0:15:47,710 --> 0:15:50,190
incites the army to mutiny against me.

164
0:15:50,190 --> 0:15:52,780
Is this how he sees me now Edward?

165
0:15:52,780 --> 0:15:54,900
As a tyrant?

166
0:15:57,220 --> 0:16:01,220
You may speak openly. Master Thurloe serves the nation.

167
0:16:03,010 --> 0:16:06,330
Freeborn John thinks he may have seen your hand at work

168
0:16:06,330 --> 0:16:08,590
in the murder of Thomas Rainsborough.

169
0:16:19,460 --> 0:16:21,980
Do the Leveller regiments talk of that?

170
0:16:21,980 --> 0:16:24,620
In secret. For there is hardly a one now in England

171
0:16:24,620 --> 0:16:25,980
does not fear the General.

172
0:16:25,980 --> 0:16:27,020
And you?

173
0:16:27,470 --> 0:16:30,090
Did you see my hand in it?

174
0:16:32,340 --> 0:16:33,780
No.

175
0:16:36,940 --> 0:16:39,260
Then will you come with me?

176
0:16:39,260 --> 0:16:40,540
To Ireland.

177
0:16:40,540 --> 0:16:42,810
To kill Papists?

178
0:16:42,810 --> 0:16:45,130
To make certain that no Scottish or French armies

179
0:16:45,130 --> 0:16:46,850
will ever find friends there.

180
0:16:47,380 --> 0:16:53,450
My army is brave but they will see sights in Ireland

181
0:16:53,450 --> 0:16:55,610
that they never thought to see.

182
0:16:55,610 --> 0:16:58,840
I need eyes with me there, who have seen those sights before.

183
0:16:58,840 --> 0:17:00,930
Your army is owed its wages.

184
0:17:01,600 --> 0:17:03,230
As we take the land from the Papists,

185
0:17:03,230 --> 0:17:06,270
we will sell it to Protestants,and pay the army its wages.

186
0:17:06,700 --> 0:17:08,510
And what of the Papists?

187
0:17:08,510 --> 0:17:09,480
When last they arose

188
0:17:09,480 --> 0:17:11,960
they killed mothers and ate their babies, sir.

189
0:17:12,260 --> 0:17:15,460
They are beyond humanity, Edward. Come with me.

190
0:17:15,460 --> 0:17:18,860
The man who stood so close to Thomas Rainsborough,

191
0:17:18,860 --> 0:17:20,860
must now stand close to me.

192
0:17:23,140 --> 0:17:26,710
Come, sir. Will you be Colonel Sexby?

193
0:17:38,900 --> 0:17:41,300
Brighten your sword, Colonel Sexby.

194
0:17:41,510 --> 0:17:43,500
The Lord has work for us both.

195
0:17:43,940 --> 0:17:46,580
You must first to Burford, Edward.

196
0:17:46,580 --> 0:17:49,420
The Leveller regiments have arrested their officers

197
0:17:49,420 --> 0:17:51,140
and refuse to march for Ireland.

198
0:17:51,140 --> 0:17:53,350
Honest John has his mutiny.

199
0:17:53,350 --> 0:17:54,600
Mutiny?

200
0:17:55,170 --> 0:17:58,190
These are brave and honest men, sir. I know them.

201
0:17:58,780 --> 0:18:02,980
Go to them as from me. Let them lay down their arms

202
0:18:02,980 --> 0:18:05,020
and release their officers.

203
0:18:05,020 --> 0:18:07,810
Tell them Old Noll will come to them in person

204
0:18:07,810 --> 0:18:12,300
and all their grievances will be heard, upon my word.

205
0:18:16,140 --> 0:18:17,820
What are your plans, madam?

206
0:18:19,420 --> 0:18:21,580
To live the life you gave me.

207
0:18:26,580 --> 0:18:28,210
What will you do?

208
0:18:28,210 --> 0:18:32,550
I go to Ireland. I have an officer's wages.

209
0:18:33,860 --> 0:18:36,240
They are yours.

210
0:18:36,560 --> 0:18:38,170
How?!

211
0:18:40,940 --> 0:18:43,220
Be my wife.

212
0:18:44,380 --> 0:18:48,190
I promised the best man in England I would protect you.

213
0:18:50,700 --> 0:18:58,730
Be my wife, in outward show only and my promise is kept.

214
0:18:59,420 --> 0:19:02,180
A woman cannot survive alone.

215
0:19:02,540 --> 0:19:04,240
No, Sexby...

216
0:19:05,900 --> 0:19:08,420
I mean to shift for myself now.

217
0:19:08,420 --> 0:19:10,980
There are Diggers at Fanshawe House.

218
0:19:10,980 --> 0:19:12,460
I mean to join them.

219
0:19:13,540 --> 0:19:16,240
The Diggers follow Thomas' dreams

220
0:19:16,240 --> 0:19:18,210
Land a commonwealth, property levelled

221
0:19:18,210 --> 0:19:20,130
and every man's conscience his own.

222
0:19:20,130 --> 0:19:23,140
The Diggers will not take you in if you be unmarried.

223
0:19:23,140 --> 0:19:24,730
Consider.

224
0:19:27,540 --> 0:19:29,430
I do not ask for love.

225
0:19:29,650 --> 0:19:31,980
I do not ask for...

226
0:19:31,980 --> 0:19:34,620
a marriage bed.

227
0:19:34,620 --> 0:19:37,460
I ask only that you let me serve you.

228
0:19:57,070 --> 0:19:59,310
Would you have me write you letters?

229
0:20:06,700 --> 0:20:08,250
Sexby...

230
0:20:08,640 --> 0:20:09,940
Why have you done this?

231
0:20:15,220 --> 0:20:17,620
Duty, madam.

232
0:20:20,180 --> 0:20:22,220
A promise given.

233
0:20:26,620 --> 0:20:30,280
Freeborn John writes us this message from the Tower.

234
0:20:32,060 --> 0:20:35,660
"If Cromwell is allowed to go on as he is,

235
0:20:35,660 --> 0:20:37,630
"he will make himself King

236
0:20:38,420 --> 0:20:42,850
"and there will be nothing but cutting of throats, year..."

237
0:20:43,790 --> 0:20:46,060
Make way for Colonel Sexby!

238
0:20:49,740 --> 0:20:53,100
This you may not do and still be soldiers.

239
0:20:53,100 --> 0:20:56,460
Untie your officers. This defiance cannot go on.

240
0:20:58,940 --> 0:21:01,780
Give them their weapons and their horses.

241
0:21:03,100 --> 0:21:04,940
Be not afraid of them hereafter.

242
0:21:04,940 --> 0:21:08,170
One greater than them comes to listen to you.

243
0:21:08,170 --> 0:21:09,950
The General himself.

244
0:21:11,100 --> 0:21:15,020
Now hear me. Throw your weapons up here.

245
0:21:15,560 --> 0:21:16,980
Do it now.

246
0:21:16,980 --> 0:21:19,470
Nay! Never!

247
0:21:22,960 --> 0:21:24,500
Come now.

248
0:21:25,540 --> 0:21:30,060
Let none say you drew your weapons at Old Noll.

249
0:21:32,940 --> 0:21:35,500
When you speak, he will listen.

250
0:21:37,260 --> 0:21:40,580
When he speaks, you will listen.

251
0:21:40,580 --> 0:21:43,540
He will give you orders and you will obey them.

252
0:21:43,540 --> 0:21:46,140
There will be no reprisals.

253
0:21:46,140 --> 0:21:49,340
This he has promised me and I promise you the same.

254
0:21:50,700 --> 0:21:52,900
In the name of Thomas Rainsborough.

255
0:21:52,900 --> 0:21:55,540
Rainsborough! Rainsborough!

256
0:22:38,900 --> 0:22:40,340
General!

257
0:22:45,780 --> 0:22:48,040
You thought to mutiny?

258
0:22:48,750 --> 0:22:50,850
You thought to imprison your officers?

259
0:22:51,230 --> 0:22:54,840
You thought to give orders to the Army Council?

260
0:22:54,840 --> 0:22:57,000
Show me the ringleaders.

261
0:22:57,700 --> 0:23:00,260
They will face a court martial immediately.

262
0:23:06,830 --> 0:23:08,370
Sir!

263
0:23:08,620 --> 0:23:10,380
Your part is played, Colonel.

264
0:23:13,540 --> 0:23:15,700
Fire!

265
0:23:24,500 --> 0:23:26,220
You kept no covenant with us.

266
0:23:33,620 --> 0:23:36,450
Is there is anyone who will not willingly submit to my will

267
0:23:36,450 --> 0:23:38,420
and accept my pardon?

268
0:23:43,670 --> 0:23:45,900
Do you wish to resign your commission, Edward?

269
0:23:50,660 --> 0:23:53,680
Ireland is our back door. It must be bolted.

270
0:23:55,900 --> 0:23:58,320
We march for Ireland.

271
0:25:00,890 --> 0:25:03,050
Thomas Rainsborough

272
0:25:05,620 --> 0:25:07,600
Why keep that one?

273
0:25:11,400 --> 0:25:12,970
Why this one?

274
0:25:13,510 --> 0:25:15,330
Thomas Rainsborough lies there.

275
0:25:15,500 --> 0:25:17,710
Should be at the head of England.

276
0:25:20,570 --> 0:25:22,920
What's your business here, madam?

277
0:25:23,780 --> 0:25:25,420
I come to dig, if you will let me.

278
0:25:27,630 --> 0:25:28,910
Your name?

279
0:25:30,170 --> 0:25:32,240
Sexby.

280
0:25:33,940 --> 0:25:35,790
Mistress Sexby.

281
0:25:35,790 --> 0:25:37,690
Your husband?

282
0:25:37,690 --> 0:25:38,990
Gone from me.

283
0:25:42,350 --> 0:25:43,770
Dead?

284
0:25:44,740 --> 0:25:46,710
Not dead.

285
0:25:47,260 --> 0:25:49,180
Gone to Ireland.

286
0:25:52,140 --> 0:25:54,300
Come with me, Mistress Sexby.

287
0:26:02,300 --> 0:26:04,660
Mistress Sexby wishes to live among us.

288
0:26:04,660 --> 0:26:07,340
Her husband is fighting in Ireland.

289
0:26:07,340 --> 0:26:09,420
You are welcome, Mistress Sexby.

290
0:26:10,100 --> 0:26:14,390
Those who work, eat. We share all.

291
0:26:36,780 --> 0:26:39,060
Your story is written in your hands.

292
0:26:41,820 --> 0:26:44,380
I think you were not born to this work.

293
0:26:48,260 --> 0:26:49,820
My name is Christian.

294
0:26:52,900 --> 0:26:55,980
Tell me about the man in the earth whose grave you tend.

295
0:26:55,980 --> 0:26:58,740
I never knew him but by report.

296
0:27:00,340 --> 0:27:03,100
He raised up the common man.

297
0:27:03,100 --> 0:27:09,060
He fought for his liberty against the rich...and mighty.

298
0:27:09,060 --> 0:27:10,620
Truly, I wish he was here.

299
0:27:12,260 --> 0:27:13,860
Wishing will not bring him.

300
0:27:13,860 --> 0:27:15,940
Nay but he should be here,

301
0:27:15,940 --> 0:27:20,110
for we are living in the best and last of days.

302
0:27:20,580 --> 0:27:22,630
Our last days are near?

303
0:27:23,060 --> 0:27:26,710
Christ is ready to walk the earth again.

304
0:27:26,710 --> 0:27:29,700
Do you not feel his love all around you?

305
0:27:31,460 --> 0:27:33,740
Christ Jesus has come to me.

306
0:27:33,940 --> 0:27:36,290
Tell us what you saw, Jocelyn.

307
0:27:36,660 --> 0:27:40,850
He came down last night and lay by me in my bed.

308
0:27:40,900 --> 0:27:42,660
told me he would come soon

309
0:27:42,660 --> 0:27:45,620
and rain upon the earth 10,000 years.

310
0:27:47,400 --> 0:27:50,200
Shall we pray, Mistress Sexby?

311
0:27:52,540 --> 0:27:56,140
Oh, mighty God, who throughout the mouths of babes

312
0:27:56,140 --> 0:27:59,140
and sucklings have ordained strength

313
0:27:59,140 --> 0:28:03,740
and make of infants to glorify thy name with their innocence.

314
0:28:03,740 --> 0:28:06,240
Inspire us with thy grace...

315
0:28:09,450 --> 0:28:11,290
Another sign.

316
0:29:07,820 --> 0:29:09,220
Come.

317
0:29:09,220 --> 0:29:10,780
We begin again.

318
0:29:51,330 --> 0:29:53,690
Colonel, did your party reach Wexford?

319
0:29:53,690 --> 0:29:55,770
We were held a while at Arklow, General.

320
0:29:55,770 --> 0:29:58,250
It must be removed from our path.

321
0:29:58,250 --> 0:30:00,170
It is done. The garrison fled.

322
0:30:00,170 --> 0:30:02,010
What's left has been driven into a bog.

323
0:30:02,010 --> 0:30:03,910
There they wait for you.

324
0:30:06,270 --> 0:30:08,840
Is this the flower of all their army?

325
0:30:09,350 --> 0:30:10,930
Bring them out.

326
0:30:10,930 --> 0:30:12,750
They are stuck fast.

327
0:30:12,750 --> 0:30:14,090
How many are they?

328
0:30:14,090 --> 0:30:15,440
Twelve.

329
0:30:15,440 --> 0:30:19,370
Twelve bullets then. We're short on powder and shot.

330
0:30:47,850 --> 0:30:49,410
Make ready the cannon!

331
0:30:55,650 --> 0:30:57,750
Are you ready to surrender, sir?

332
0:30:58,770 --> 0:31:01,450
Resist and you will blow you all to atoms.

333
0:31:01,870 --> 0:31:03,810
I cannot.

334
0:31:04,700 --> 0:31:06,600
Surrender and you live.

335
0:31:06,600 --> 0:31:09,060
Resist and your entire garrison will be put to the sword

336
0:31:09,060 --> 0:31:10,410
man and boy

337
0:31:18,090 --> 0:31:20,090
I may not.

338
0:31:28,170 --> 0:31:29,840
He has orders.

339
0:31:29,840 --> 0:31:32,280
He will not defend the town purposefully

340
0:31:32,280 --> 0:31:35,620
but needs to make a show of a fight before he surrenders.

341
0:31:37,610 --> 0:31:40,550
Purposeful or no, they will die, all of them.

342
0:31:40,550 --> 0:31:43,730
I'll drag no prisoners across this benighted land.

343
0:31:43,730 --> 0:31:45,730
Wake me when the walls are breached.

344
0:31:52,490 --> 0:31:53,930
Prepare to die.

345
0:32:09,540 --> 0:32:09,610
Ready?

346
0:32:09,610 --> 0:32:12,690
Fire the cannon!

347
0:33:05,020 --> 0:33:06,280
Edward!

348
0:33:28,410 --> 0:33:32,120
I hate to see any man's resting place neglected.

349
0:33:32,120 --> 0:33:34,030
Let me help you.

350
0:33:39,810 --> 0:33:41,860
Harry Fanshawe.

351
0:33:41,860 --> 0:33:43,790
I wonder what he was?

352
0:33:49,810 --> 0:33:51,610
Your words moved me, sir.

353
0:33:53,890 --> 0:33:57,930
When you said these days were like the days of Christ on earth.

354
0:33:58,920 --> 0:34:00,760
Full of love.

355
0:34:01,650 --> 0:34:05,170
I feel that love in these good people's hearts.

356
0:34:05,170 --> 0:34:07,410
They are good people.

357
0:34:07,410 --> 0:34:11,090
But they know not the intenseness of the times.

358
0:34:11,090 --> 0:34:13,650
But I believe that you do.

359
0:34:13,650 --> 0:34:16,220
I believe that you taste

360
0:34:16,220 --> 0:34:18,560
the rare and beautiful air that we breathe.

361
0:34:22,930 --> 0:34:24,450
I have a sin to confess.

362
0:34:26,050 --> 0:34:28,570
I am no priest, sir.

363
0:34:28,570 --> 0:34:31,570
When I thought I heard you say that your husband was dead...

364
0:34:34,890 --> 0:34:36,570
..my heart was glad.

365
0:34:39,810 --> 0:34:41,410
He lives...still.

366
0:34:41,410 --> 0:34:43,550
Though he be far away.

367
0:34:44,810 --> 0:34:46,760
Goodnight.

368
0:34:50,370 --> 0:34:53,310
Both your husbands are dead, madam.

369
0:34:54,280 --> 0:34:56,970
And lie here at my feet.

370
0:34:59,370 --> 0:35:00,970
I will tell no other.

371
0:35:01,920 --> 0:35:02,870
For truly I think this

372
0:35:02,870 --> 0:35:05,510
the bravest and best thing that any woman ever did.

373
0:35:05,510 --> 0:35:07,250
How do you know me?

374
0:35:08,850 --> 0:35:12,010
My mother worked in your kitchens.

375
0:35:17,930 --> 0:35:19,970
They hanged me as The Devil's Whore.

376
0:35:19,970 --> 0:35:21,870
Then I love the Devil's whore,

377
0:35:21,870 --> 0:35:26,110
for truly I could never love my lady Angelica Fanshawe.

378
0:35:26,340 --> 0:35:28,420
She is far above me.

379
0:35:29,210 --> 0:35:32,220
Though I would give my life for her.

380
0:35:35,850 --> 0:35:38,940
Be not so eager to give your life, Christian.

381
0:35:39,810 --> 0:35:43,090
You may not be given another, as I was.

382
0:36:18,170 --> 0:36:19,530
Come.

383
0:36:19,530 --> 0:36:22,690
The owner of the land will never let us be.

384
0:36:22,690 --> 0:36:25,930
Master Joliffe is not the true owner of the land.

385
0:36:25,930 --> 0:36:27,650
We are the owners of the land

386
0:36:27,650 --> 0:36:30,630
for we work the land and we make it fruitful.

387
0:36:30,630 --> 0:36:32,110
Master Joliffe?

388
0:36:32,110 --> 0:36:35,250
Aye, given it by Parliament.

389
0:36:35,250 --> 0:36:37,350
These things began when she came.

390
0:36:38,180 --> 0:36:40,760
You think I brought these things upon you?

391
0:36:40,760 --> 0:36:44,090
The Devil's work began when you came among us,

392
0:36:44,090 --> 0:36:47,600
with his mark upon your neck. That is all.

393
0:37:00,750 --> 0:37:02,660
They are frightened.

394
0:37:03,480 --> 0:37:05,420
I will leave tomorrow.

395
0:37:05,420 --> 0:37:08,240
I will follow you to the end of the earth.

396
0:37:08,240 --> 0:37:09,440
Christian...?

397
0:37:09,440 --> 0:37:13,070
It is our desire, madam, that you leave us.

398
0:37:15,640 --> 0:37:17,600
You have your wish,

399
0:37:17,600 --> 0:37:19,330
even though this life here

400
0:37:19,330 --> 0:37:21,850
began to light a candle of hope in my heart.

401
0:37:21,890 --> 0:37:24,670
We will not have fornicators!

402
0:37:24,670 --> 0:37:26,320
I saw them.

403
0:37:26,990 --> 0:37:29,110
She saw nothing. The child imagines things.

404
0:37:29,110 --> 0:37:30,710
I see the Devil at her side.

405
0:37:30,730 --> 0:37:32,310
She gave Satan her baby.

406
0:37:32,310 --> 0:37:34,340
In God's name, make an end of this.

407
0:37:34,340 --> 0:37:36,910
No, sir, we will make an end of you and this woman,

408
0:37:36,910 --> 0:37:38,340
for if we do not,

409
0:37:38,340 --> 0:37:40,750
our enemies will call us polygamists and drive us off!

410
0:37:40,750 --> 0:37:43,450
Your enemies mean to drive you off in any case, Maddy, and...

411
0:37:44,060 --> 0:37:46,960
not for a kiss in the night.

412
0:37:46,960 --> 0:37:49,430
Because you tell them to love their fellow men

413
0:37:49,430 --> 0:37:51,120
more than money or land!

414
0:37:51,150 --> 0:37:53,850
Was it not love that brought you together? Then...

415
0:37:53,850 --> 0:37:57,090
No more, madam. You must both be gone tomorrow.

416
0:37:57,090 --> 0:37:59,650
We will be gone. Fear not.

417
0:38:00,530 --> 0:38:02,310
But I leave you with one question.

418
0:38:02,310 --> 0:38:04,910
If all on earth are equal,

419
0:38:04,910 --> 0:38:07,740
why do the women work in the fields in the day

420
0:38:07,740 --> 0:38:10,090
and make the men's dinners at night?

421
0:38:18,130 --> 0:38:21,410
Sometimes we see what's not there.

422
0:38:22,160 --> 0:38:24,640
We see demons of our own conjuring.

423
0:38:50,450 --> 0:38:54,830
I demand the release of my husband, John Lilburne!

424
0:38:54,830 --> 0:38:56,440
Why do you sit here with your bellies full

425
0:38:56,440 --> 0:38:58,750
while famine grips the city?!

426
0:38:58,750 --> 0:38:59,660
No women in this chamber!

427
0:38:59,660 --> 0:39:01,250
Why is the Army forced to Ireland!?

428
0:39:01,250 --> 0:39:03,590
We have no fights in Ireland!

429
0:39:03,590 --> 0:39:04,820
Get you home and wash dishes.

430
0:39:04,820 --> 0:39:07,320
They are sold to feed my children!

431
0:39:07,320 --> 0:39:08,730
Leave her.

432
0:39:11,820 --> 0:39:15,500
John will have a fair trial, on my word.

433
0:39:15,500 --> 0:39:18,100
Sir...

434
0:39:18,100 --> 0:39:21,340
If you take away John's life,

435
0:39:21,340 --> 0:39:22,980
I will have yours!

436
0:39:33,260 --> 0:39:35,500
Will they hang you today, John?

437
0:39:35,500 --> 0:39:37,860
Hang me? Ask my wife if they will hang me!

438
0:39:37,860 --> 0:39:40,220
I have spent nine shillings on a new pair of boots!

439
0:39:40,220 --> 0:39:42,420
New boots! See?

440
0:39:44,780 --> 0:39:46,740
New boots!

441
0:39:59,660 --> 0:40:01,180
John Lilburne.

442
0:40:02,900 --> 0:40:05,040
Where is he? Let me shake his hand.

443
0:40:05,530 --> 0:40:07,940
Do you say you are not John Lilburne?

444
0:40:07,940 --> 0:40:09,420
Why should I say I am John Lilburne

445
0:40:09,420 --> 0:40:11,260
when 'tis said you will hang him for treason?

446
0:40:11,260 --> 0:40:13,380
I say nothing on the matter.

447
0:40:13,380 --> 0:40:16,380
You are charged with being the author of these pamphlets,

448
0:40:16,380 --> 0:40:18,980
which urge the Army to seditious mutiny.

449
0:40:18,980 --> 0:40:20,180
How me, sir?

450
0:40:21,320 --> 0:40:23,900
For that it says the name "John Lilburne" upon them.

451
0:40:23,900 --> 0:40:27,430
Why, any man may write "John Lilburne."

452
0:40:27,430 --> 0:40:28,860
Do you deny being the author of these pamphlets?

453
0:40:28,860 --> 0:40:31,650
What need I deny it when I have not said that I am John Lilburne?

454
0:40:32,170 --> 0:40:35,660
And where is the man can prove a single soldier mutinied

455
0:40:35,660 --> 0:40:37,630
on account of these pamphlets, in any case?

456
0:40:37,630 --> 0:40:39,500
Where are your witnesses?

457
0:40:39,540 --> 0:40:41,540
All in Ireland!

458
0:40:45,660 --> 0:40:48,890
I prithee, let me see the charges

459
0:40:48,890 --> 0:40:50,790
and have time to study the case!

460
0:40:50,900 --> 0:40:52,820
Sir, you mock this court!

461
0:40:52,820 --> 0:40:55,180
No, sir! You mock this court,

462
0:40:55,180 --> 0:40:58,500
as you mock justice, as you mock truth and liberty!

463
0:40:58,500 --> 0:41:00,180
But they will not be mocked forever,

464
0:41:00,180 --> 0:41:01,860
in the name of Almighty God in heaven!

465
0:41:04,380 --> 0:41:05,700
Ah, now I remember me you!

466
0:41:05,700 --> 0:41:09,060
Were not you, sir, and you, sir,

467
0:41:10,010 --> 0:41:12,060
and yes, you, sir, all on the King's side

468
0:41:12,060 --> 0:41:14,280
when first we began our quarrel?

469
0:41:14,840 --> 0:41:16,300
Until, as I remember,

470
0:41:16,300 --> 0:41:18,990
until Oliver's Army began to turn the tide when

471
0:41:18,990 --> 0:41:22,710
God's amazement - you found yourselves coming over.

472
0:41:22,710 --> 0:41:26,060
Whereas John Lilburne, wherever he may be,

473
0:41:26,290 --> 0:41:31,110
did fight at Kineton and at Newbury and at Marston Field!

474
0:41:35,380 --> 0:41:38,290
My bladder is swollen, sir. May I go out to relieve myself?

475
0:41:38,290 --> 0:41:39,360
No, sir.

476
0:41:39,360 --> 0:41:41,460
Then bring me a pot to piss in!

477
0:42:06,780 --> 0:42:07,860
Sirrahs...

478
0:42:08,890 --> 0:42:12,580
I am Honest John Lilburne, author of the pamphlets

479
0:42:12,580 --> 0:42:14,660
that urge the army to resist

480
0:42:14,660 --> 0:42:19,070
an unlawful and barbaric war in Ireland.

481
0:42:20,020 --> 0:42:22,260
And you, my fellow citizens,

482
0:42:22,260 --> 0:42:25,740
are the only judges that matter in this place.

483
0:42:27,650 --> 0:42:30,180
You, and you alone, have the decision.

484
0:42:30,540 --> 0:42:33,700
My life is in your hands.

485
0:43:05,980 --> 0:43:08,700
Men of the jury, what is your verdict?

486
0:43:09,670 --> 0:43:11,760
We have found John Lilburne...

487
0:43:13,580 --> 0:43:15,900
..not guilty.

488
0:43:44,940 --> 0:43:46,540
I am glad to see you alive.

489
0:43:48,540 --> 0:43:49,860
"Glad?"

490
0:43:51,190 --> 0:43:52,810
Who is he?

491
0:43:56,200 --> 0:43:58,000
A friend.

492
0:43:58,660 --> 0:44:00,620
I never misled you, Sexby.

493
0:44:00,620 --> 0:44:03,300
You asked for no love, nor marriage bed,

494
0:44:03,300 --> 0:44:05,660
and my heart promised you neither.

495
0:44:05,660 --> 0:44:06,400
Aye, but madam,

496
0:44:06,400 --> 0:44:08,820
I never thought you would dishonour me before all eyes.

497
0:44:09,460 --> 0:44:10,230
You are not dishonoured,

498
0:44:10,230 --> 0:44:12,730
save your taking part in Irish massacres.

499
0:44:16,860 --> 0:44:19,020
I thought of you every minute.

500
0:44:19,020 --> 0:44:22,180
While you slaughtered other men's wives and children?

501
0:44:28,860 --> 0:44:30,820
What now?

502
0:44:30,820 --> 0:44:32,260
I am your wife.

503
0:44:34,300 --> 0:44:35,980
I am yours to command.

504
0:44:38,220 --> 0:44:40,300
I do not command.

505
0:44:40,300 --> 0:44:43,500
You must go wherever your heart inclines you.

506
0:44:44,590 --> 0:44:46,460
Then fare you well.

507
0:44:51,420 --> 0:44:53,820
Wait.

508
0:44:53,820 --> 0:44:56,860
I command.

509
0:45:06,020 --> 0:45:09,980
What is your future? More soldiering?

510
0:45:09,980 --> 0:45:11,580
I am a spoiled soldier...

511
0:45:13,180 --> 0:45:14,740
..for which I am glad.

512
0:45:14,740 --> 0:45:19,060
For truly, I have seen my fill of butchering in this vile world.

513
0:45:19,060 --> 0:45:21,100
The world is not vile...

514
0:45:23,500 --> 0:45:25,900
..though some are that are in it.

515
0:45:29,260 --> 0:45:31,860
Even they can be saved by love, I think.

516
0:45:31,860 --> 0:45:32,980
Love?

517
0:45:32,980 --> 0:45:34,580
Aye, love.

518
0:45:34,580 --> 0:45:37,900
I think you do not know it.

519
0:45:37,900 --> 0:45:40,540
And I pity you for it.

520
0:45:41,810 --> 0:45:43,140
Did love help the Diggers

521
0:45:43,140 --> 0:45:45,110
when the army trampled their fields?

522
0:45:45,640 --> 0:45:46,500
No.

523
0:45:46,500 --> 0:45:48,500
What did love do for any man,

524
0:45:48,500 --> 0:45:51,490
except make him run like a fool to his destruction?

525
0:45:51,490 --> 0:45:54,180
The Diggers had not too much love, sir, but too little.

526
0:45:54,180 --> 0:45:59,580
But there are those who believe that love can save us all.

527
0:46:01,580 --> 0:46:02,620
Ranters?

528
0:46:02,620 --> 0:46:04,500
Only their enemies call them that.

529
0:46:04,500 --> 0:46:06,140
They call themselves the High Attainers,

530
0:46:06,140 --> 0:46:07,620
and I have made friends amongst them.

531
0:46:07,620 --> 0:46:09,340
Ranters?!

532
0:46:10,190 --> 0:46:11,890
Sir, you are drunk.

533
0:46:12,380 --> 0:46:17,620
Madam, do you know where this "love" will bring you?

534
0:46:19,260 --> 0:46:22,100
Do you know they have made female adultery a capital offence?

535
0:46:22,100 --> 0:46:25,460
If you continue as you are, they will hang you again.

536
0:46:25,460 --> 0:46:27,700
Who will save you? That boy?

537
0:46:27,700 --> 0:46:28,700
That "boy", sir,

538
0:46:28,700 --> 0:46:30,900
may not know how to split a man open with his sword,

539
0:46:30,900 --> 0:46:32,460
but he sees the truth in us.

540
0:46:32,460 --> 0:46:33,860
In who? In me?

541
0:46:34,720 --> 0:46:36,090
In me.

542
0:46:37,620 --> 0:46:40,180
In us all. He sees love shining in our hearts,

543
0:46:40,180 --> 0:46:42,420
and he sees what it can do here, on earth.

544
0:46:42,420 --> 0:46:47,180
Sexby, what use to bring down kings or parcel out land,

545
0:46:47,180 --> 0:46:50,180
if we do not share all that is in us?

546
0:46:52,170 --> 0:46:57,980
Madam...do you lie with him?

547
0:46:57,980 --> 0:46:59,740
Like all men, you are a fool when you drink.

548
0:46:59,740 --> 0:47:03,220
Do you lie with him? Have you lain with him?

549
0:47:03,220 --> 0:47:05,360
Let me go from here, sir.

550
0:47:05,360 --> 0:47:06,340
Where to?

551
0:47:08,700 --> 0:47:09,660
To him?

552
0:47:14,620 --> 0:47:18,100
Oh, he "loves" you. He loves your innards,

553
0:47:18,100 --> 0:47:20,620
where the light does shine, whereas I...

554
0:47:20,620 --> 0:47:27,530
Sexby, I can never love you.

555
0:47:28,780 --> 0:47:30,980
Ever.

556
0:47:32,120 --> 0:47:34,180
I am sorry for you.

557
0:47:37,140 --> 0:47:40,980
I am grateful to you.

558
0:47:44,580 --> 0:47:47,010
But I will never love you.

559
0:48:10,140 --> 0:48:13,210
Why do you stop, sir? The law says you own me.

560
0:48:19,620 --> 0:48:22,260
Live as you please. You are free.

561
0:48:23,240 --> 0:48:25,310
But there is no freedom.

562
0:48:26,480 --> 0:48:29,220
Except that which comes with money and power.

563
0:48:32,460 --> 0:48:34,540
If you know of any other kind, then...

564
0:48:36,540 --> 0:48:39,930
..you must run after it.

565
0:48:40,760 --> 0:48:42,190
Go.

566
0:48:46,850 --> 0:48:48,370
GO!

567
0:49:15,060 --> 0:49:17,140
Where is Christian?

568
0:49:27,620 --> 0:49:29,540
She must not escape a third time.

569
0:49:29,540 --> 0:49:32,100
She'll not, sir.

570
0:49:32,100 --> 0:49:34,820
I've led her by the nose like a willing sow.

571
0:49:36,360 --> 0:49:39,190
And she truly believed The Diggers

572
0:49:39,710 --> 0:49:44,250
Yes,sir.She gave her heart to fools and thieves.

573
0:49:44,690 --> 0:49:45,860
And now?

574
0:49:46,270 --> 0:49:49,790
