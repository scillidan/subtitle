我压死你了 - 你什么都不会做

抓紧我
Hold me tightly!

163
0:19:15,610 --> 0:19:20,030
他拉了门 但打不开这太超现实了
He pulled the door, but could not open it. lt was so surreal.

164
0:19:20,280 --> 0:19:23,240
一个拿着枪的老人
An old man with a gun.

165
0:19:24,740 --> 0:19:27,540
然后 我听到了自杀的枪声
Then l heard the shot when he killed himself.

166
0:19:27,740 --> 0:19:31,410
你确定他想联系利斯贝思吗

是的 太可怕了 我从来没有这么害怕过

你想让我下来吗 - 不

0:19:39,050 --> 0:19:45,680
没这个必要 我将和我的朋友维拉·科伦德一起住在卡尔托普
That's not necessary. l will stay with my friend Vera Åkerlund in Kålltorp.

173
0:19:59,570 --> 0:20:03,200
为什么警察不设立一个更好的警戒呢
Why didn't the police set up a better watch?

174
0:20:03,410 --> 0:20:06,780
太不可思议了你不会想到这样的事情会发生在这里
Absolutely incredible. You wouldn't think such things could happen here.

175
0:20:06,950 --> 0:20:12,660
携带武器进入医院科室并杀害病人 真的令人难以置信
To go armed into a hospital department and kill a patient, is really unbelievable!

176
0:20:53,620 --> 0:20:56,000

你知道发生了什么吗 - 萨拉琴科中枪了
Do you know what happened? - Zalachenko has been shot.

182
0:21:31,660 --> 0:21:35,620
似乎是埃弗特·古尔伯格开枪打死了他
lt seems Evert Gullberg shot him.

183
0:21:35,790 --> 0:21:39,380
下面一片混乱目前还没有任何消息得到证实
lt's chaos down there. Nothing has been confirmed.

184
0:21:39,540 --> 0:21:44,760
那么 我会确认的是埃弗特开枪打死了他
Then l will confirm it. lt was Evert who shot him.

185

见鬼 你在说什么 什么计划

188
0:22:03,440 --> 0:22:09,200
古尔伯格只剩下几个月的生命了他得了肝癌
Gullberg had only a few months left to live. He had liver cancer.

189
0:22:11,450 --> 0:22:14,830
他选择为我们做最后的努力
He chose to make one last effort for us.

190
0:22:16,040 --> 0:22:18,290
他光荣地牺牲了
He died with honour.

191
0:22:20,830 --> 0:22:25,670
你知道他会杀了萨拉琴科吗 - 当然
Did you know he would kill Zalachenko? - Of course.

192
0:22:25,840 --> 0:22:31,340
他的任务是让萨拉琴科闭嘴
His mission was to silence Zalachenko.

193
0:22:31,550 --> 0:22:34,970
还有萨兰德 就像是计划好的一样

194
0:22:40,100 --> 0:22:43,730
你跟古尔伯格一样神经错乱吗
Are you as fucking deranged as Gullberg?

195
0:22:44,820 --> 0:22:49,990
说话注意点 霍尔伯格这是一个正确的决定
Watch your tongue, Hallberg. It was the right decision.

196
0:22:50,240 --> 0:22:54,240
我们做了必要的事情 - 有必要吗 决定
We did what was necessary. - Necessary? Decision?

197
0:22:54,490 --> 0:22:59,620
你和古尔伯格根本没有权力做任何决定 该死的
You and Gullberg had no mandate to take any decision at all, damn it!

198
0:22:59,870 --> 0:23:05,380
无论发生什么：萨拉琴科的死永远不会与我们有关
Whatever happens: Zalachenko's death will never be related to us.

199
0:23:06,340 --> 0:23:09,590
也不是埃弗特·古尔伯格的
Nor Evert Gullberg's.

200
0:23:13,260 --> 0:23:18,390
我们的任务是做出决定
Our task is to take decisions...

201
0:23:18,640 --> 0:23:21,520
这是其他人都不敢做的
...that no one else dares.

202
0:23:23,150 --> 0:23:27,150
最不用说的是政客就这么简单
Least of all politicians. It's that simple.

203
0:23:28,990 --> 0:23:31,490
还有一件事
One more thing...

208
0:23:50,300 --> 0:23:56,010
已经被确认为78岁的养老金领取者

他曾当过会计师和税务律师

和莉斯贝丝·萨兰德有联系吗

0:24:09,570 --> 0:24:14,070
我们可以坚决否认与利斯贝丝·萨兰德之间可能存在的联系
We can firmly deny a possible link with Lisbeth Salander.

213
0:24:14,280 --> 0:24:18,450
似乎是一个单独的袭击者采取了
It seemed to be a single assailant who has acted...

214
0:24:18,660 --> 0:24:22,960
基于他自己偏执的想象力
...based upon his own paranoid imagination.

215
0:24:23,170 --> 0:24:29,170
他向著名的政治家和媒体发出了令人困惑的信息

216
0:24:29,340 --> 0:24:33,670
对亚历山大·萨拉琴科发出死亡威胁

217
0:24:33,840 --> 0:24:39,430

警方的新闻发布会到此结束

219
0:24:42,850 --> 0:24:48,230
我们回到哥德堡Sahlgrenska医院的事件中

0:27:24,390 --> 0:27:26,600
我认为我们做不到
l do not think we can.

237
0:27:39,740 --> 0:27:46,370
只有上了锁的门和精神评估才能把她关起来
Only locked doors and a psychiatric assessment will confine her.

238
0:27:46,530 --> 0:27:50,660
她必须因谋杀萨拉琴科未遂而受到惩罚

239
0:27:50,910 --> 0:27:55,250

为什么不在圣斯蒂芬这里呢 - 是的

248

还有那个为萨拉琴科工作的金发肌肉男

他是利斯贝丝·萨兰德同父异母的兄弟

0:28:52,600 --> 0:28:57,230
萨拉琴科在汉堡与一名女子有染

254
0:29:07,070 --> 0:29:10,450
这听起来像是一场该死的希腊悲剧

255
0:29:10,620 --> 0:29:15,500
萨拉琴科试图在她哥哥的帮助下杀害他的女儿

有人骑滑板车抢走了我的包
Someone on a scooter snatched my bag.

274
0:31:52,030 --> 0:31:55,410
对利斯贝思·萨兰德的起诉并不复杂
The indictment against Lisbeth Salander is not complicated.

275
0:31:55,620 --> 0:31:59,410
即使原告萨拉琴科已经死了
Even if the plaintiff Zalachenko is dead.

276
0:32:01,000 --> 0:32:06,380
然而 如果关于萨拉琴科的一切都公之于众 那么这将是一场非常复杂的审判
However, if everything about Zalachenko comes out, then it's going to be a very complicated trial.

277
0:32:08,050 --> 0:32:12,420
它关乎人命 关乎我们与外国势力的关系

对于对利斯贝丝·萨兰德的起诉来说 这份报告几乎没有相关性
For the prosecution of Lisbeth Salander the report has little relevance...

281
0:32:24,650 --> 0:32:27,650
检察官已经没收了它
...and the Director of Public Prosecutions has confiscated it.

282
0:32:27,820 --> 0:32:30,650
然而 它的部分内容是有用的
Nevertheless, parts of it are useful.

283
0:32:30,820 --> 0:32:35,450
尤其是利斯贝丝·萨兰德过去曾试图暗杀她的父亲
Especially where Lisbeth Salander tried to assassinate her father in the past.

284
0:32:35,700 --> 0:32:38,830
我看看你能不能接触到那个部分

这意味着你不能和任何人谈论这件事 除了我
This means that you cannot talk to anyone about this but me.

290
0:33:04,440 --> 0:33:07,560
我会非常谨慎的
I will be very discreet.

291
0:33:17,240 --> 0:33:19,740

My name is Peter Teleborian.

293
0:33:23,450 --> 0:33:28,380
我是乌普萨拉圣斯蒂芬精神病院的一名医生
l am a doctor at St. Stephen's psychiatric clinic in Uppsala.

294
0:33:28,630 --> 0:33:31,130
我有话跟你说
l need to talk to you.

295
0:33:31,340 --> 0:33:35,630
是关于你的一个病人 丽斯贝丝·萨兰德
It is about one of your patients, Lisbeth Salander.

296
0:33:35,880 --> 0:33:40,350
我明白了 - 好吧 好吧
I see... - Well... okay.

297
0:33:43,890 --> 0:33:48,230
我从她12岁起就开始和她打交道 
I have been dealing with her since she was twelve years old...

298
0:33:48,480 --> 0:33:52,520
我对她的临床情况有很好的了解
...and I have a very good understanding of her clinical picture.

299
0:33:52,780 --> 0:33:57,280
它看起来像什么 - 丽斯贝丝有严重的精神障碍
What does it look like? - Lisbeth is seriously mentally disturbed.

300
0:33:57,490 --> 0:34:03,040
她有明显的妄想症和精神分裂症的特征
She has overt delusions with paranoid and schizophrenic features.

301
0:34:03,290 --> 0:34:08,540
像所有反社会的人一样 她完全缺乏同理心
And like all sociopaths she completely lacks empathy.

302
0:34:08,790 --> 0:34:11,670
简单地说
To put it simply.

303
0:34:11,840 --> 0:34:17,590
我认为她是一个封闭的人 但不是一个偏执的反社会者
I perceive her as a closed person, but not as a paranoid sociopath.

304
0:34:17,840 --> 0:34:21,680
她非常善于操纵 这是疾病图景的一部分
She is extremely manipulative, which is part of the disease picture.

305
0:34:21,930 --> 0:34:25,720
她展示了她认为你想看的东西
She shows what she thinks you want to see.

306
0:34:25,980 --> 0:34:30,480
正如你所理解的 我对她的精神状况感到非常担忧
As you will understand, l feel great concern about her mental condition.

307
0:34:30,730 --> 0:34:32,440
我知道了
Yes, I understand.

308
0:34:32,610 --> 0:34:38,200
我得去见她 在开庭前评估一下她的情况
I'll have to see her to assess her condition before the trial.

309
0:34:38,360 --> 0:34:41,820
那件事我帮不了你
I cannot help you with that.

310
0:34:43,950 --> 0:34:46,370
利斯贝丝由 我负责
l am responsible for Lisbeth.

311
0:34:46,580 --> 0:34:51,460
除了她的律师之外 她身体不够强壮 不能见任何人
She is not strong enough to meet anyone other than her lawyer.

312
0:34:51,630 --> 0:34:56,250
我已受检察官指示与她见面
l have been instructed by the prosecutor to meet with her.

313
0:34:58,010 --> 0:35:02,510
我曾希望避免拘泥于礼节 但现在我想我不得不这样了
I had hoped to avoid being formal, but now I suppose I'll have to be.

314
0:35:02,760 --> 0:35:07,140
作为一名医生 你应该知道我的评估是适用的
As a doctor you should know that it's my assessment that applies...

315
0:35:07,390 --> 0:35:10,480
无论检察官的决定如何
...regardless of prosecutor decisions.

316
0:35:10,730 --> 0:35:14,400
因此 你必须耐心等待 直到 我改变我的评估
Therefore, you will have to be patient and wait until l change my assessment.

317
0:35:18,650 --> 0:35:21,030
好吧
Well...

318
0:35:23,660 --> 0:35:28,040
我曾希望得到一个更专业的回应
I had hoped for a more professional response.

319
0:35:32,420 --> 0:35:35,630
我们能排除政府对此知情的可能性吗
Can we rule out government knowledge of it?

320
0:35:35,800 --> 0:35:41,380
他们一定知道有一名俄罗斯间谍叛逃到瑞典
They must have known that a Russian spy defected to Sweden.

321
0:35:41,550 --> 0:35:45,510
76年萨拉琴科叛逃时 我们有一个保守的政府
We had a conservative government in '76 when Zalachenko defected.

322
0:35:45,680 --> 0:35:48,310
30年来 没有任何东西泄露出去
30 years and nothing has leaked out.

323
0:35:48,560 --> 0:35:52,940
如果许多政客都知道这件事 这件事就不可能保密
lt could not be kept secret, if a lot of politicians were aware of it.

324
0:35:53,190 --> 0:35:55,810
他们中的许多人现在都在写传记
A lot of them write biographies now.

325
0:35:56,070 --> 0:36:00,940
安全局也是如此它迟早会泄露出去的
The same goes for the Security Service. lt would have leaked out sooner or later.

326
0:36:02,030 --> 0:36:07,160
一定有一个小的秘密组织在自己行动
There must be a small secret group acting on their own.

327
0:36:07,330 --> 0:36:09,700
拥有大量的资源和影响力
With substantial resources and influence.

328
0:36:09,910 --> 0:36:15,580
如果30年来没有人泄露这个组织的消息 我们从哪里开始挖掘
lf nobody has leaked about the group in 30 years, where do we start digging?

329
0:36:15,790 --> 0:36:18,710
我们最好的线索是埃弗特·古尔伯格
The best lead we have is Evert Gullberg.

330
0:36:20,210 --> 0:36:23,800
如果我们对他有更多的了解 就有可能有所进展
If we find out more about him, there is a chance of getting somewhere.

331
0:36:23,970 --> 0:36:27,350
然而 这不能花太长时间 否则千禧年将陷入困境
However, it must not take too long or Millennium will be in trouble.

332
0:36:27,600 --> 0:36:31,180
这本杂志必须与审判同时出版
The magazine must be out simultaneously with the trial.

333
0:36:45,110 --> 0:36:47,120
请看着这个
Keep your eye on this, please.

334
0:36:50,870 --> 0:36:55,370
我做得怎么样 - 你明显进步了
How am I doing? - You are clearly improving.

335
0:36:57,880 --> 0:37:03,840
我将确保你得到帮助 开始康复
l will ensure that you get help to get started with rehabilitation.

336
0:37:04,010 --> 0:37:08,850
我不需要帮助 - 你有 不要刮伤疤
I do not need help. - You do. Don't scratch the scab.

337
0:37:10,640 --> 0:37:13,640
此外 你应该吃得更好
Moreover, you should eat better.

338
0:37:14,640 --> 0:37:16,980
你应该对食物做点什么
You should do something about the food.

339
0:37:17,230 --> 0:37:21,110
吃的 - 给我拿个披萨或类似的东西
The food? - Get me a pizza or something like that.

340
0:37:22,150 --> 0:37:28,410
我怀疑预算是否足够买披萨
I doubt the budget is sufficient for pizza.

341
0:37:29,620 --> 0:37:33,160
一位彼得·泰尔博里安医生想见你
A Dr. Peter Teleborian wanted to see you.

342
0:37:35,000 --> 0:37:38,790
他说你们过去有过接触
He said that you'd had contact in the past.

343
0:37:42,000 --> 0:37:45,380
无论如何 他不得不空手而归
Anyway, he had to leave empty - handed.

344
0:37:47,300 --> 0:37:49,140
很好
Good...

345
0:38:46,990 --> 0:38:49,610
显然这是给你的
Apparently this is for you.

346
0:39:38,660 --> 0:39:43,380
你好我们在利斯贝丝·萨兰德被带到医院的那晚见过面
Hello. We met at the hospital the night Lisbeth Salander was brought in.

347
0:39:43,540 --> 0:39:47,550
是的 我确实记得 - 我想和你谈一件事
Yes, I do remember. - l want to talk to you about something.

348
0:39:47,800 --> 0:39:51,670
我不会透露有关利斯贝丝·萨兰德的信息
I will not disclose information about Lisbeth Salander.

349
0:39:51,880 --> 0:39:57,930
不 我想给你一些关于丽斯贝丝的信息重要信息
No, I want to give you information about Lisbeth. Important information.

350
0:40:00,180 --> 0:40:05,150
像这样的阴谋 抱歉 听起来不太可能
A conspiracy like that... sorry, but it sounds very unlikely.

351
0:40:05,310 --> 0:40:10,530
我理解你的看法 但 我向你保证：一切都是真的
I understand that you see it that way, but l assure you: everything is true.

352
0:40:10,690 --> 0:40:14,450
一切都可以记录下来 我会公布整个故事
Everything can be documented and l will publish the whole story.

353
0:40:14,700 --> 0:40:19,200
我为利斯贝思的庭审辩护这就是我在这里的原因
I built Lisbeth's defence for her trial. That's why I am here.

354
0:40:21,290 --> 0:40:25,330
我只想问你一件事 - 什么
l'm only going to ask you about one thing. - What?

355
0:40:25,580 --> 0:40:28,590
丽斯贝丝有秘密
Lisbeth has secrets.

356
0:40:30,090 --> 0:40:34,090
私人的她可能需要它们来为自己辩护
Private ones. She may need them for her defence.

357
0:40:34,340 --> 0:40:37,930
以获取她需要的证据
To access the evidence she will need this.

358
0:40:41,230 --> 0:40:46,100
检察官已经施加了限制 - 这就是 我问你的原因
The prosecutor has imposed restrictions. - That's why l'm asking you.

359
0:40:50,480 --> 0:40:53,320
嗨 你好吗 - 很好
Hi, how are you doing? - Fine.

360
0:40:54,360 --> 0:40:56,610
我可以给你做个简单的检查吗 - 可以
May I give you a brief examination? - Yes.

361
0:40:57,450 --> 0:40:59,580
我们来看看
Let's have a look...

你感觉到疼痛吗 - 没有
Do you feel any pain? - No.

363
0:41:05,750 --> 0:41:08,880
头疼呢 - 还不错
What about headaches? - Not bad.

364
0:41:09,090 --> 0:41:12,210
它们正在逐渐消失 - 那很好
They are disappearing gradually. - That's good.

365
0:41:13,090 --> 0:41:15,880
斯德哥尔摩警方又打来电话
The Stockholm police called again.

366
0:41:16,140 --> 0:41:20,640
汉斯·法斯特是他的名字他称自己是调查的负责人
Hans Faste was his name. He described himself as in charge of the investigation.

367
0:41:20,890 --> 0:41:23,640
他想来这里审问你
He wanted to come here and interrogate you.

368
0:41:23,890 --> 0:41:27,100
你的头能稍微向后仰一点吗
Can you bend your head slightly backwards?

369
0:41:27,350 --> 0:41:32,780
不会太远他们如此执着 我有点恼火
Not too far. I was a little annoyed that they are so persistent.

370
0:41:33,780 --> 0:41:38,160
我不能再用你的身体状况来拒绝他了
l cannot use your medical condition to refuse him much longer.

371
0:41:38,410 --> 0:41:42,910
你进步很快你明白吗
You are improving rapidly. Do you understand?

372
0:41:43,160 --> 0:41:47,870
我告诉他 你还需要几个星期的时间来康复
l told him that you need a couple of weeks more to rehabilitate.

373
0:41:49,250 --> 0:41:54,510
然后你将被转移到斯德哥尔摩的监狱
You will then be moved to jail in Stockholm.

374
0:41:54,670 --> 0:41:59,430
我看到你背上的纹身了它看起来很大
I saw the tattoo on your back. It seems quite large.

375
0:41:59,640 --> 0:42:03,140
你为什么要这么做 - 为什么这么问
Why did you get it done? - Why do you ask?

376
0:42:03,390 --> 0:42:06,810
纯粹的好奇心 - 由于私人原因 我不会讨论
Pure curiosity. - For private reasons I will not discuss.

377
0:42:08,810 --> 0:42:11,440
好吧抱歉的

378
0:42:23,410 --> 0:42:26,660

Your autobiography.

383
0:43:13,250 --> 0:43:18,760
安妮卡不知道你现在有了PDA 最好还是让它保持原样
Annika doesn't know that you have your PDA now, and it's better to keep it that way.

384
0:43:19,010 --> 0:43:22,340
我应该把DVD给她吗
Should I give her the DVD?

385
0:43:22,510 --> 0:43:25,970
我们还需要更多地了解Teleborian
We also need to know more about Teleborian.

386
0:43:26,140 --> 0:43:30,270
我住在你的公寓里我的手机被监视了 可能还被窃听了
I live in your apartment. Mine is under surveillance and probably bugged.

387
0:43:41,280 --> 0:43:46,780
谋杀嫌疑人利斯贝丝·萨兰德将从哥德堡的萨尔格伦斯卡被转移
Murder suspect Lisbeth Salander will be transferred from Sahlgrenska in Göteborg...

审判定于今年11月初进行
The trial is scheduled for the beginning of November this year.

391
0:44:09,430 --> 0:44:11,680
瘟疫 你在吗
Plague, are you there?

392
0:44:55,600 --> 0:45:01,110
把DVD给安妮卡也没关系不过 我将亲自写下这起强奸事件
It's okay to give the DVD to Annika. However, l will write about the rape myself.

393
0:45:01,990 --> 0:45:04,950
我已经联系了普雷格关于Teleborian的事情
I have contacted Plague about Teleborian.

394
0:45:05,110 --> 0:45:08,830
如果他发现了什么 他会联系你的
He will contact you if he finds something.

395
0:45:38,900 --> 0:45:41,900
我与政府有关联
l have a link to the government.

396
0:45:42,150 --> 0:45:47,780
猜猜1976年10月5日 谁在内阁府拜访了首相
Guess who visited the Prime Minister at the Cabinet Office on October 5, 1976?

No takers? Evert Gullberg and a person named Hans von Rottinger.

0:45:54,120 --> 0:45:57,500
在萨拉琴科叛逃三周后 他们就在那里
They were there three weeks after Zalachenko defected.

399
0:45:57,670 --> 0:46:02,170
你怎么知道的 - 我查了留言簿
How did you find out? - I checked the visitor's book.

只有一次访问 那是1976年10月5日
There was only one visit, on October 5, 1976.

401
0:46:07,930 --> 0:46:10,010

402
0:46:10,180 --> 0:46:16,310
然而 必须证明他们在那里是为了提供关于萨拉琴科的信息
Nevertheless, it must be proved that they were there to provide information on Zalachenko.

403
0:46:17,270 --> 0:46:22,270
有什么记录吗 - 没有 只有名字和日期
Were there any notes? - No, just names and dates.

404
0:46:23,690 --> 0:46:28,450
我们要怎么做 - 我们必须检查国务卿
How do we proceed? - We must check the Secretaries of State.

405
0:46:28,700 --> 0:46:33,200
在那里工作的两个人可能知道些什么 - 我们有名字吗

其中一人去世 另一人是一名退休大使
One is dead and the other one is a retired ambassador.

407
0:46:37,080 --> 0:46:40,670
他的名字叫Bengt Janeryd 住在格里斯勒姆郊外
His name is Bengt Janeryd and he lives outside Grisslehamn.

408
0:46:40,830 --> 0:46:45,460
我们应该和他聊聊 - 很好 我会处理好的
We should have a chat with him. - Good. I'll take care of that.

409
0:46:45,710 --> 0:46:49,720
我比你更了解这个案子 所以我对他更危险
I know the case better than you do, so I am more dangerous to him.

410
0:46:57,060 --> 0:46:59,440
我就是这么说的 - 是的 我听到你说的了
lt's just what I say. - Yes, I heard what you said...

411
0:46:59,690 --> 0:47:01,600
地址是什么
Address?

412
0:47:02,730 --> 0:47:04,690
好吧
Okay.

413
0:47:07,990 --> 0:47:10,070
而你
And you...

414
0:47:10,240 --> 0:47:12,320
干得好
...well done!

415
0:47:35,220 --> 0:47:39,390
你一定知道古尔伯格枪杀了萨拉琴科 对吧
You must know that Gullberg has shot Zalachenko, right?

416
0:47:39,640 --> 0:47:42,270
你在报纸上看到了吗 - 是的
Did you read it in the newspapers? - Yes.

417
0:47:43,110 --> 0:47:49,030
你为什么不报警 - 我一直在等他们的电话
Why didn't you call the cops? - I waited for them to call.

418
0:47:49,280 --> 0:47:53,280
这听起来有点方便 - 我对女儿一无所知
That sounds a little convenient. - l knew nothing about his daughter.

419
0:47:53,530 --> 0:47:56,530
她所遭受的痛苦是可怕的
What she suffered is terrible.

420
0:47:56,740 --> 0:48:00,410
然而 首相并不知道这一点
However, the prime minister was not aware of it.

421
0:48:00,620 --> 0:48:02,370
我也不是
Neither was l.

422
0:48:03,290 --> 0:48:07,380
你最好说服我和千禧年读者相信这一点
You'd better convince me and the Millennium readers about that.

423
0:48:07,550 --> 0:48:12,170
我禁止你在这种情况下使用我的名字
I forbid you to use my name in this context.

424
0:48:12,430 --> 0:48:15,430
我与此无关
l didn't have anything to do with it.

425
0:48:16,140 --> 0:48:18,810
我在这里读到的东西对我来说是新的
What I read here is new to me.

426
0:48:19,060 --> 0:48:24,440
你只读了我们将出版的部分材料我们有更多的信息
You have read only some of the material we will publish. We have a lot more.

427
0:48:24,690 --> 0:48:26,810
一切都是可以证明的
Everything can be proved.

428
0:48:27,070 --> 0:48:31,820
我不会把你挂在外面 但你有责任 有责任
l will not hang you out, but you have a responsibility and a liability.

429
0:48:32,070 --> 0:48:36,410
所以要么你现在就告诉我 要么你一直躲在你的保密背后
So either you tell me now, or you keep hiding behind your confidentiality.

430
0:48:36,580 --> 0:48:39,790
这就是我所说的勒索 - 随便你怎么叫
That's what I call blackmail. - Call it whatever you want.

431
0:48:39,950 --> 0:48:44,210
如果你开口 我答应你不提你的名字
lf you talk, l promise you not to mention your name.

446
0:49:36,760 --> 0:49:41,470
所以 后来的政府都不知道
So, no subsequent government had any idea...

447
0:49:41,720 --> 0:49:45,600
瑞典有一个苏联叛逃者

我们想知道你打算什么时候出版

494

495
0:54:29,930 --> 0:54:32,010
这也正是 我想要的
That's exactly what l want as well.

But l also want to get Lisbeth Salander acquitted and be declared legally competent.

Moreover, l am the one who received those e - mails. I will not act behind Mikael's back.

你永远不会明白触摸是治疗的一部分
You never understood that touch was part of the treatment...

740
1:23:47,390 --> 1:23:51,600
它创造了亲密和信任
...and that it creates closeness and trust.

741
1:23:53,520 --> 1:23:56,650
这尤其适用于儿童
This applies in particular to children.

我正在写作 然后把它关掉了
I was writing and had it turned off.

747
1:24:33,270 --> 1:24:35,690
同一个发送者

748
1:24:38,690 --> 1:24:43,780
克里斯特今天试着报警了但我阻止了他
Christer tried to call the police today. But I stopped him.

749
1:24:45,830 --> 1:24:49,200
我们必须马上解决这件事 迈克

750
1:24:50,290 --> 1:24:53,330
你和我在经营这本杂志
You and I are running the magazine.

751
1:24:53,580 --> 1:24:58,340

1:24:58,550 --> 1:25:02,720
我已经联系了利斯贝思的黑客伙伴之一 普雷格
l've contacted one of Lisbeth's hacker buddies, Plague.

753
1:25:02,930 --> 1:25:05,340
这样我们就不用向警方报告了
So we don't have to report it to the police?

754
1:25:05,600 --> 1:25:09,970
如果有人能找到发送者 那就是他 但这需要时间
If anyone can find the sender, then it's him, but it takes time.

755
1:25:10,230 --> 1:25:12,980
它会比警察更快

756
1:25:13,230 --> 1:25:16,560
我们说的是几天吗 或者几个星期
Are we talking about days? Or weeks?

757
1:25:20,740 --> 1:25:23,110
坦率地说 我并不知道
Frankly, l do not know.

758
1:25:25,370 --> 1:25:30,700
如果我们假设千禧年有什么要出版的
If we assume that Millennium has something to publish...

759
1:25:30,870 --> 1:25:33,000
那他们还能有什么呢
...then what can they possibly have?

760
1:25:33,210 --> 1:25:39,210
最糟糕的情况是 他们有一份比约克调查的副本
The worst - case scenario is that they have a copy of Björck's investigation.

763
1:25:55,980 --> 1:26:00,730
也许我们可以以某种方式降低可信度
Maybe we could reduce the credibility somehow?

764
1:26:05,530 --> 1:26:08,370
总之
Anyway...

765
1:26:08,530 --> 1:26:12,910
我们必须结束这一切 一劳永逸

You should do that now. lt's about physical threats towards you and Erika.

你公寓里的无声闹钟昨晚响了
The silent alarm in your apartment went off last night.

777
1:27:40,710 --> 1:27:45,380

...and 120,000 Swedish crowns in cash in your wardrobe.

779

见鬼 - 他们想陷害你
What the hell?! - They're trying to set you up.

780
1:27:53,760 --> 1:27:57,140
因为他们不能冲击杂志

1:35:18,670 --> 1:35:22,290
并将其与南斯拉夫的毒品交易联系在一起
...and associate it with a Yugoslav drug deal.

857
1:35:22,460 --> 1:35:27,720
那办公室里的其他人呢 - 我们要把办公室关几天
What about the others at the office? - We're closing the office for a couple of days.

858
1:35:27,970 --> 1:35:33,100
我们还将推迟该杂志的出版
We will also postpone the publication of the magazine.

859
1:35:34,720 --> 1:35:37,730
那么 我建议对你和艾瑞卡进行个人保护
Then l suggest personal protection for you and Erika.

860
1:35:37,940 --> 1:35:41,860
不 我不想有人跟踪我
No, l don't want anyone following me.

861
1:35:43,110 --> 1:35:48,450
我们将看看事情现在会如何发展 - 你和她联系过了吗
We'll see how things develop now. - Have you contacted with her?

862
1:35:49,610 --> 1:35:51,490
接下来会发生什么
What's going to happen?

863
1:35:51,700 --> 1:35:54,990
我将首先坚持丽斯贝丝·萨兰德的精神治疗
I will insist firstly on psychiatric care for Lisbeth Salander...

864
1:35:55,240 --> 1:35:58,500
其次是长期监禁
...and secondly a long prison sentence.

865
1:35:58,710 --> 1:36:01,250
难道这不应该是反过来的吗
Shouldn't that be the other way round?

866
1:36:01,460 --> 1:36:04,130
是的 但在这种情况下
Yes, but in this case...

867
1:36:04,340 --> 1:36:08,260
精神病学报告是如此明确
...the psychiatric report is so explicit...

868
1:36:08,470 --> 1:36:11,260
我别无选择
...that l have no alternative.

869
1:36:11,510 --> 1:36:13,390
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

870
1:36:14,600 --> 1:36:19,520
利斯贝丝·萨兰德的审判在斯德哥尔摩地区法院开始
The trial of Lisbeth Salander starts here in Stockholm's District Court...

871
1:36:19,730 --> 1:36:22,980
下午1点 大约一个小时后
...at 1 p.m., in about an hour.

872
1:36:23,150 --> 1:36:29,530
如你所见 预计将持续三天 面对大量观众
lt is expected to last three days, before a large audience, as you can see.

873
1:36:29,780 --> 1:36:33,410
在初步调查中 警方和检察官
During preliminary investigation the police and the prosecutor...

874
1:36:33,660 --> 1:36:37,790
已经向媒体提供了信息 而辩方拒绝置评
...have given information to the media, while the defence has refused to comment...

875
1:36:38,000 --> 1:36:41,410
天哪时间到了吗
My God. ls it time?

876
1:36:44,500 --> 1:36:47,750
我昨晚一夜没合眼 - 一切都会好起来的
I did not sleep a wink last night. - Everything will be fine.

877
1:36:47,920 --> 1:36:50,010
当然
Of course...!

878
1:36:54,050 --> 1:36:56,140
一切都会好的
It will be OK.

879
1:36:57,390 --> 1:37:01,680
真的 - 谢谢再见再见
Indeed! - Thank you. See you later. Bye - bye.

880
1:38:22,770 --> 1:38:25,350
再多一点 再多一点
A little more, a little more.

881
1:38:55,550 --> 1:38:57,510
我只能后悔
I can only regret...

882
1:38:57,760 --> 1:39:02,310
利斯贝丝·萨兰德在七次听证会上一句话也没说
...that Lisbeth Salander didn't say a single word during the seven hearings.

883
1:39:02,560 --> 1:39:07,440
然而 这一事实并没有削弱任何指控
However, that fact does not weaken any of the charges.

884
1:39:07,690 --> 1:39:09,520
谢谢
Thank you.

885
1:39:09,690 --> 1:39:13,820
然后我让辩方发言
Then I give the floor to the defence.

886
1:39:14,070 --> 1:39:15,940
谢谢
Thank you.

887
1:39:17,070 --> 1:39:20,820
从辩方来看 我们拒绝所有指控
From the defence side we reject all the charges.

888
1:39:21,080 --> 1:39:25,290
我们将证明检察官的说法是不正确的
We will prove that the prosecutor's claims are incorrect...

889
1:39:25,450 --> 1:39:29,460
而且我的当事人面临严重的违法行为
...and that my client has been exposed to serious legal violations.

890
1:39:29,710 --> 1:39:33,170
我会要求宣判我的当事人无罪
l will demand that my client be declared innocent...

891
1:39:33,340 --> 1:39:37,840
废除她的监护权 并立即释放她
...that her guardianship be abolished and that she be released immediately.

892
1:39:38,970 --> 1:39:40,840
谢谢
Thank you.

893
1:39:41,100 --> 1:39:44,220
检察官有什么要补充的吗
Does the prosecutor have anything to add?

894
1:39:44,470 --> 1:39:51,350
出于几个原因 我建议这场审判闭门进行
For several reasons I propose that this trial be conducted behind closed doors.

895
1:39:51,610 --> 1:39:56,110
此案关乎弱势群体的精神状况和福利
The case is about the mental condition and the welfare of a vulnerable person...

896
1:39:56,320 --> 1:39:59,610
以及被归类为机密的材料
...and about material that is classified as confidential...

897
1:39:59,820 --> 1:40:04,240
而且在某些地区可能会影响到国家安全
...and in some areas may impact on national security.

898
1:40:10,580 --> 1:40:12,880
我们今晚再谈
We'll talk tonight.

899
1:40:25,010 --> 1:40:26,890
看起来不错
That looks good.

900
1:40:27,640 --> 1:40:32,900
我将从努力带来一些澄清开始
l will start with an effort to bring some clarity...

901
1:40:33,110 --> 1:40:36,270
你去戈塞贝加的原因
...to your reasons for going to Gosseberga...

902
1:40:36,530 --> 1:40:41,150
试图杀死你的父亲亚历山大·萨拉琴科
...to try to kill your father, Alexander Zalachenko.

903
1:40:47,160 --> 1:40:51,160
我们应该把你的沉默理解为你不回答问题的声明吗
Should we interpret your silence as a statement that you will not answer questions?

904
1:40:51,370 --> 1:40:54,250
我将乐于回答问题
l will happily answer questions.

905
1:40:56,800 --> 1:40:59,670
那么也许你可以回答这个问题
Then maybe you can answer the question.

906
1:40:59,880 --> 1:41:03,180
我没有听到任何问题
I have not heard any question.

907
1:41:05,260 --> 1:41:09,560
我问你去戈塞贝加有没有杀你父亲的意图
l asked if you went to Gosseberga with the intention to kill your father.

908
1:41:09,810 --> 1:41:13,270
不 你说过你想试着阐明
No, you said you wanted to try to shed light...

909
1:41:13,440 --> 1:41:17,690
我为什么要去戈塞贝加试图杀死我的父亲
...on why I went to Gosseberga in an attempt to kill my father.

910
1:41:17,940 --> 1:41:21,440
这是一个概括性的声明 你在其中预料到了我的回答
That was a general statement in which you anticipated my answer.

911
1:41:21,700 --> 1:41:25,070
回答问题 - 没有
Answer the question. - No.

912
1:41:25,820 --> 1:41:29,950
不什么 - 这就是问题的答案
"No" what? - That's the answer to the question.

913
1:41:37,340 --> 1:41:40,800
你有没有用斧头砍你父亲的头
Did you strike your father's head with an axe?

914
1:41:40,960 --> 1:41:42,470
是
Yes.

915
1:41:42,670 --> 1:41:47,600
他受了重伤 我辩称这是谋杀未遂
He was seriously injured and l argue that this is attempted murder.

916
1:41:48,850 --> 1:41:50,560
你的看法是什么
What is your view?

917
1:41:50,810 --> 1:41:54,730
这是两项指控 我应该对哪一个有意见
Those were two allegations. On which one should l have an opinion?

918
1:41:54,980 --> 1:41:58,980
如果用斧头砍你父亲的头是谋杀未遂
If striking your father in the head with an axe was attempted murder.

919
1:41:59,190 --> 1:42:02,820
那不是谋杀未遂这是自卫
That was not attempted murder. lt was self - defence.

920
1:42:15,000 --> 1:42:16,620
谢谢
Thank you.

921
1:42:16,830 --> 1:42:19,880
如果你需要什么 请告诉我
Tell me if you need anything.

922
1:42:20,090 --> 1:42:23,840
你能拿到香烟吗 - 算了吧
Can you get cigarettes? - Forget it.

923
1:42:35,140 --> 1:42:36,890
谢谢
Thank you.

924
1:42:48,160 --> 1:42:50,490
你好 - 嗨
Hello. - Hi.

925
1:43:00,750 --> 1:43:05,380
被看守的感觉如何 - 还不错
How does it feel to be guarded? - Well, not bad.

926
1:43:05,550 --> 1:43:08,680
只要他们待在外面
As long as they stay outside.

927
1:43:16,060 --> 1:43:18,190
埃里卡
Erika...

928
1:43:20,810 --> 1:43:23,320
我做不到
I couldn't do it.

929
1:43:31,070 --> 1:43:33,330
你是个自我主义者
You are an egotist.

930
1:43:33,580 --> 1:43:35,830
还是个白痴
And an idiot.

931
1:43:42,960 --> 1:43:48,050
我这周将呆在家里下个星期
l will stay at home this week. And next week.

932
1:43:48,300 --> 1:43:52,850
我想确定 我的决定是正确的
I want to be sure that l made the right decision.

933
1:43:53,100 --> 1:43:54,720
好吧
Well...

934
1:44:00,850 --> 1:44:04,360
关于我们还是关于千禧年
About us or about Millennium?

935
1:44:04,610 --> 1:44:07,190
关于这两件事
About both...

936
1:44:07,360 --> 1:44:09,450
我想
...I think.

937
1:44:11,240 --> 1:44:13,320
我会保持联系的
I'll be in touch.

938
1:44:19,120 --> 1:44:21,120
你自己多保重
Take care of yourself.

939
1:44:24,460 --> 1:44:25,880
该死的
Damn it.

940
1:44:39,640 --> 1:44:42,140
萨兰德 是时候了
Salander, it's time.

941
1:44:46,480 --> 1:44:50,780
丽斯贝丝·萨兰德的所谓自传
Lisbeth Salander's so - called autobiography...

942
1:44:50,990 --> 1:44:53,660
缺乏任何可信度
...lacks any credibility.

943
1:44:55,030 --> 1:44:58,660
有许多针对不同人的指控
There are a number of allegations against different people...

944
1:44:58,910 --> 1:45:01,500
每个人都比另一个人更荒谬
...each one more absurd than the other.

945
1:45:02,540 --> 1:45:05,290
一切都是一种表达
Everything is an expression...

946
1:45:05,500 --> 1:45:10,670
莉斯贝丝·萨兰德所患的偏执型精神分裂症
of the paranoid schizophrenia Lisbeth Salander is suffering from.

947
1:45:11,680 --> 1:45:13,760
你能举个例子吗
Can you give an example?

948
1:45:13,930 --> 1:45:20,310
最明显的是对强奸的刻画 
The most obvious is the portrayal of rape...

949
1:45:20,560 --> 1:45:22,940
其中 - 她声称
...of which - she alleges...

950
1:45:23,190 --> 1:45:28,070
她的监护人 律师比约曼 会被判有罪
...her guardian, advocate Bjurman, would be guilty of.

951
1:45:28,280 --> 1:45:33,320
整个故事 所有的细节 
The whole story, with all the details...

952
1:45:33,530 --> 1:45:39,450
是怪诞幻想的经典例子
...is a classic example of the grotesque fantasies...

953
1:45:39,700 --> 1:45:43,330
孩子们倾向于展示的东西
...which children tend to exhibit.

954
1:45:45,040 --> 1:45:48,960
但利斯贝丝·萨兰德不再是一个孩子了 她是一个成年女性
But Lisbeth Salander is not a child anymore, she is an adult woman.

955
1:45:49,210 --> 1:45:51,550
还有待决定
lt still remains to be decided...

956
1:45:51,720 --> 1:45:58,220
她现在的精神状态到底是怎样的
...on what exact mental level she is now.

957
1:45:59,350 --> 1:46:02,350
然而 原则上你是对的
However, in principle you are right.

958
1:46:03,480 --> 1:46:05,730
我明白
I understand.

959
1:46:08,320 --> 1:46:14,110
1993年 利斯贝思·萨兰德在圣斯蒂芬医院被迫入院
ln 1993 Lisbeth Salander underwent forced admission at St. Stephen's hospital.

960
1:46:15,200 --> 1:46:18,620
在她住在那里的那些年里 你要对她负责
During the years she lived there, you were responsible for her.

961
1:46:18,830 --> 1:46:21,490
对吗 - 对
ls that correct? - Yes.

962
1:46:22,870 --> 1:46:26,370
她在床上躺了几天
How many days did she lie tied up?

963
1:46:26,580 --> 1:46:29,210
换句话说：被夹在床上
ln other words: clamped to the bed.

964
1:46:29,380 --> 1:46:33,130
我不太记得了但不是很多
I cannot quite remember. But not very many.

965
1:46:34,010 --> 1:46:36,010
大约有多少人
How many approximately?

966
1:46:37,260 --> 1:46:42,470
有可能 三十次但我不明白这个问题的相关性
Possibly... thirty times. But I don't understand the relevance of this question.

967
1:46:42,720 --> 1:46:46,890
利斯贝丝·萨兰德本人声称这是381天
Lisbeth Salander herself claims it was 381 days.

968
1:46:47,150 --> 1:46:51,110
这纯粹是幻想这没有任何意义
That is pure fantasy. It doesn't make any sense.

969
1:46:51,270 --> 1:46:54,780
所以你是说 她躺在床上不超过一年
So you're telling me, she did not lie tied up more than one year...

970
1:46:55,030 --> 1:46:58,410
她在那里住了两年 - 当然不是
...of the two years she lived there? - Of course not.

971
1:46:59,410 --> 1:47:05,660
辩方一再试图调取莉斯贝丝·萨兰德的档案
The defence has repeatedly tried to get Lisbeth Salander's files...

972
1:47:05,910 --> 1:47:10,790
讲述了她在圣斯蒂芬医院被迫入学的几年 但没有成功
...covering the years of her forced admission at St. Stephen's, but without success.

973
1:47:11,040 --> 1:47:15,420
你能解释一下为什么吗 - 因为这是保密的
Can you explain why? - Because it's classified as confidential.

974
1:47:15,670 --> 1:47:19,930
这是这类研究的一般规则
That is a general rule for this kind of study.

975
1:47:20,180 --> 1:47:23,060
作为律师 你应该知道这一点
You as a lawyer should know that.

976
1:47:23,310 --> 1:47:28,190
在这里 我有一份利斯贝思·萨兰德的卷宗 关于两年的时间：
Here l have a copy of Lisbeth Salander's dossier, regarding two years:

977
1:47:28,440 --> 1:47:31,560
1993年和1994年
1993 and 1994.

978
1:47:32,770 --> 1:47:38,650
这里清楚地写着 莉斯贝丝·萨兰德被绑了381天
Here it's clearly stated that Lisbeth Salander was tied up for 381 days.

979
1:47:38,820 --> 1:47:44,200
詹尼尼辩护律师 这与这场审判有什么相关性
Advocate Giannini, what is the relevance of that for this trial?

980
1:47:44,450 --> 1:47:49,710
我想证明彼得·泰尔博里安在这个问题上没有说实话
I want to prove that Peter Teleborian is not telling the truth on this subject.

981
1:47:49,960 --> 1:47:57,210
詹尼尼律师 1993年和1994年的记录不能在今天使用
Advocate Giannini, records from 1993 and 1994 cannot be used today...

982
1:47:57,420 --> 1:48:02,550
质疑彼得·泰尔博里安的可信度
...to question Peter Teleborian's credibility.

983
1:48:05,560 --> 1:48:07,480
我明白
I understand.

984
1:48:53,360 --> 1:48:55,900
我觉得自己像个白痴
I felt like an idiot.

985
1:48:56,110 --> 1:49:02,400
当检察官提交Teleborian的新报告时 我将一无所获
When the prosecutor submits Teleborian's new report, l will have gained nothing.

986
1:49:04,030 --> 1:49:08,910
她会再次被送进精神病院 而我什么也做不了
She will end up in the mental hospital again and I can't do a damn thing.

987
1:49:48,540 --> 1:49:53,080
欢迎来到你的私人小女孩们
Welcome to your private young girls.

988
1:50:33,000 --> 1:50:34,750
你是谁
Who are you?

989
1:50:34,960 --> 1:50:36,960
瘟疫
Plague.

990
1:50:39,460 --> 1:50:41,710
这是什么
What is this?

991
1:50:41,880 --> 1:50:46,130
彼得·泰尔博里安的私人电脑一份USB拷贝
Peter Teleborian's private PC. A USB copy.

992
1:50:48,640 --> 1:50:51,390

I'm sorry. Come in.

993
1:50:54,640 --> 1:50:57,140
里面装的是什么
What does it contain?

994
1:50:57,350 --> 1:50:59,860
你需要的一切
Everything you need.

995
1:51:02,150 --> 1:51:05,490
外加一些肮脏的垃圾
Plus some nasty shit.

996
1:51:23,800 --> 1:51:29,300
安妮卡 我这里有你们需要的一切与部门的合作

997

998
1:51:33,890 --> 1:51:37,940

1:51:38,140 --> 1:51:40,770
好了 你来了太棒了
Well, there you are. Excellent.

1:51:40,940 --> 1:51:44,570
这里 - 我永远没有时间把这些都读完
Here. - I will never have time to read all this.

1001
1:51:44,820 --> 1:51:48,570
在午餐时读一读日期很重要
Read it during lunch. The dates are important.

1002
1:51:48,780 --> 1:51:53,700
很好 太棒了 再见再见
Good, great! See you later. Bye - bye.

1003
1:51:57,830 --> 1:52:00,290
你最后去了圣斯蒂芬大教堂
You ended up at St. Stephen's...

1004
1:52:00,460 --> 1:52:03,840
把汽油倒在你父亲身上 然后点燃它
...after pouring petrol onto your father and lighting it.

1005
1:52:04,090 --> 1:52:07,050
是 - 你为什么要这么做
Yes. - Why did you do that?

1006
1:52:09,720 --> 1:52:13,100
因为他虐待我母亲好几年了
Because he had abused my mother for several years.

1007
1:52:13,350 --> 1:52:17,730
1993年6月12日 他如此残忍地殴打她 导致她残疾
On June 12 1993, he assaulted her so brutally that she became disabled.

1008
1:52:17,980 --> 1:52:22,860
她有永久性的脑损伤 - 你告诉别人了吗
She had permanent brain damage. - Did you tell anyone?

1009
1:52:23,730 --> 1:52:27,190
是的 对审问我的警官 
Yes, to the police officer who interrogated me...

1010
1:52:27,360 --> 1:52:32,490
给社会福利委员会 各种医生 一位牧师和那边的那头猪
...to the Social Welfare Board, various doctors, a priest and that pig over there.

1011
1:52:38,120 --> 1:52:42,620
当 我来到圣斯蒂芬教堂时 我试图解释所发生的事情
When l came to St. Stephen's, I tried to explain what had happened.

1012
1:52:42,830 --> 1:52:46,880
但他声称 这是 我的幻想作为惩罚 我被绑了起来
But he claimed that l fantasized. As punishment l was tied up.

1013
1:52:47,130 --> 1:52:51,590
那纯粹是胡说八道再说一次 这是一个事实的例子
That's pure nonsense. Again, an example of the fact...

1014
1:52:51,760 --> 1:52:56,100
你的委托人缺乏区分幻想和现实的能力
...that your client lacks the ability to separate fantasy from reality.

1015
1:52:56,260 --> 1:53:02,270
你撒谎 你这头该死的猪 - 利斯贝丝 我们在法庭上使用适当的语言
You lie, you fucking pig. - Lisbeth, in court we use proper language.

1016
1:53:04,150 --> 1:53:08,730
我现在想继续性侵
l would like to proceed now with the sexual abuse...

1017
1:53:08,900 --> 1:53:13,410
律师尼尔斯·比约曼将我的当事人暴露给了他
...to which advocate Nils Bjurman exposed my client.

1018
1:53:13,620 --> 1:53:16,280
这不是案件的一部分
That is not part of the case.

1019
1:53:16,530 --> 1:53:21,160
这些都是荒谬的指控 没有任何证据
Those are absurd allegations without any shred of evidence.

1020
1:53:21,370 --> 1:53:27,420
这是利斯贝思面临的滥用法律权力的一个例子
It is an example of the abuse of legal power to which Lisbeth has been exposed.

1021
1:53:27,670 --> 1:53:31,510
关于弗雷德里克·克林顿：他可能正在接受透析 
With respect to Frederick Clinton: he might be on dialysis...

1022
1:53:31,760 --> 1:53:34,760
在这种情况下 在卡罗林斯卡医院
...in this case, at Karolinska Hospital.

1023
1:53:35,010 --> 1:53:39,680
这里的每个人都将收到所有必要的信息
Everyone here will receive all necessary information.

1024
1:53:39,930 --> 1:53:43,940
我重复一遍第1组：Bublanski组
I repeat. Group 1 : Bublanski.

1025
1:53:44,150 --> 1:53:46,270
第2组：Svensson组
Group 2: Svensson.

1026
1:53:46,440 --> 1:53:48,520

第4组：Figuerola组
Group 4: Figuerola.

1028
1:53:51,190 --> 1:53:54,030
第5组：Holmberg组
Group 5: Holmberg.

1029
1:53:54,200 --> 1:53:59,830
如有疑问或含糊之处 你可以联系你的部门主管
In case of questions or ambiguities you can contact your chief of division.

1030
1:54:01,580 --> 1:54:03,210
祝好运
Good luck.

1031
1:54:04,210 --> 1:54:09,460
你已经宣布尼尔斯·比约曼律师强奸了你 - 是的
You have declared that advocate Nils Bjurman has raped you? - Yes.

1032
1:54:09,710 --> 1:54:13,300
这应该是什么时候发生的 - 不是 应该 
When did that supposedly happen? - Not "supposedly".

1033
1:54:13,470 --> 1:54:16,470
这件事发生在2008年2月18日星期二
It happened Tuesday, February 18, 2008...

1034
1:54:16,720 --> 1:54:21,470
和同年3月7日星期五这一点在我的传记中写得很清楚
...and Friday, March 7 of the same year. It is clearly written in my biography.

1035
1:54:21,720 --> 1:54:24,730
你向警方报案了吗 - 没有
Did you report the rape to the police? - No.

1036
1:54:24,980 --> 1:54:29,360
有何不可 - 警察从来没有听过我的话
Why not? - The police had never listened to me.

1037
1:54:32,740 --> 1:54:36,490
你有没有为你的伤势寻求医疗帮助
Did you search medical help for your injuries?

1038
1:54:36,700 --> 1:54:38,740
不是的
No.

1039
1:54:39,950 --> 1:54:43,330
你跟别人谈过了吗 - 没有
Did you talk to someone about it? - No.

1040
1:54:48,960 --> 1:54:53,630
已故的尼尔斯·比约曼从未被判有罪
The late Nils Bjurman has never been convicted of any crime.

1041
1:54:53,840 --> 1:54:58,840
他从未向警方举报过 也从未受到过任何调查
He has never been reported to the police nor has he been the subject of any investigation.

1042
1:54:59,100 --> 1:55:03,520
然而 我的任务是提醒你 萨兰德
However, it's my task to remind you that Salander...

1043
1:55:03,770 --> 1:55:07,600
被诊断为偏执型精神分裂症
...has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic.

1044
1:55:09,230 --> 1:55:12,230
她在一家儿童精神科诊所待了几年 
She has spent several years in a psychiatric clinic for children...

1045
1:55:12,400 --> 1:55:16,490
从她18岁生日起就一直受到监护
...and has been under guardianship since her eighteenth birthday.

1046
1:55:16,650 --> 1:55:21,780
无论这可能多么令人遗憾 它当然有其原因
However regrettable that may be, it has its reasons of course.

1047
1:55:23,660 --> 1:55:30,380
丽斯贝丝·萨兰德有她自己非常混乱的世界观
Lisbeth Salander has her very own confused world - view...

1048
1:55:31,290 --> 1:55:37,170
这一点在她的《自传》中表现得非常清楚
...which appears very clearly in her "autobiography".

1049
1:55:37,380 --> 1:55:41,930
在其他任何地方 她对现实的缺乏接触都没有得到如此明显的证明
Nowhere else has her lack of contact with reality been demonstrated so clearly.

1050
1:55:42,180 --> 1:55:44,010
在这种情况下
In this context...

1051
1:55:44,270 --> 1:55:49,810
我们将努力评估她的话和声明的可信度
...we will try to assess the credibility of her words and statements.

1052
1:55:52,440 --> 1:55:56,190
检察官说完了吗 - 说完了
Has the prosecutor finished? - Yes.

1053
1:55:56,400 --> 1:56:00,910
然后辩方可以提出她的证据 - 谢谢你
Then the defence may present her evidence. - Thank you.

1054
1:56:03,910 --> 1:56:09,580
彼得·泰尔博里安声称莉斯贝丝·萨兰德在撒谎
Peter Teleborian claims that Lisbeth Salander is lying...

1055
1:56:09,790 --> 1:56:14,920
关于她被律师比约曼性侵的指控
about her allegations that she was sexually abused by advocate Bjurman.

1056
1:56:15,960 --> 1:56:19,590
检察官也有同样的看法
The prosecutor is of the same opinion.

1057
1:56:20,840 --> 1:56:27,100
我现在将证明利斯贝思的断言是绝对正确的
I will now demonstrate that Lisbeth's assertion is absolutely true.

1058
1:56:28,480 --> 1:56:31,350
这段录音是什么时候录制的
When was this recording made?

1059
1:56:31,560 --> 1:56:35,480
2008年3月7日 我用的是隐藏式摄像头
On March 7, 2008. l used a hidden camera.

1060
1:56:48,750 --> 1:56:51,000
如果你对我好
If you are nice ...

1061
1:56:51,250 --> 1:56:53,830
如果你
lf you...

1062
1:56:54,000 --> 1:56:56,880
如果你对我好
If you are nice...

1063
1:57:02,640 --> 1:57:04,890
那么 我就会很友善
...Then l'll be nice.

1064
1:57:06,850 --> 1:57:09,020
你会表现得友善些吗
Are you going to be nice?

1065
1:57:09,270 --> 1:57:12,270
你人好吗 你对我好吗
Are you nice? Are you being nice?

1066
1:57:15,770 --> 1:57:17,980
现在已经太晚了
It is too late now.

1067
1:57:28,410 --> 1:57:30,500
别拍了
Stop the film!

1068
1:57:30,660 --> 1:57:32,660
足够了
That's enough!

1069
1:57:43,180 --> 1:57:46,930
你为什么要拍 - 尼尔斯·比约曼以前强奸过我
Why did you film it? - Nils Bjurman had raped me before.

1070
1:57:47,180 --> 1:57:49,310
他强迫我给他口交
He had forced me to give him oral sex.

1071
1:57:49,560 --> 1:57:53,310
如果 我想要我的钱 他会要求更多的性生活
He demanded more sex if l wanted my money.

1072
1:57:53,520 --> 1:57:56,690
这是获取不利于他的证据的唯一途径
It was the only way to obtain evidence against him.

1073
1:57:56,940 --> 1:58:00,820
唯一能让他停下来的方法
The only way to make him stop.

1074
1:58:01,900 --> 1:58:05,450
我们休息一下休息一小时
We'll take a break. A one hour break.

1075
1:58:50,490 --> 1:58:54,580
对不起 我来晚了 - 没关系的谢谢
Sorry I am late. - lt's okay. Thank you.

1076
1:58:57,130 --> 1:59:00,380
你要提交新的文件吗
Are you presenting new documents?

1077
1:59:00,590 --> 1:59:05,880
不 它们与最高法院已经拥有的相同 但有微小但关键的区别
No, they are the same as the court already has, however, with minor but crucial differences.

1078
1:59:06,090 --> 1:59:08,510
我稍后会讲到的
l will come to it later.

1079
1:59:08,760 --> 1:59:12,470
然后我让辩方发言 - 谢谢你
Then I give the floor to the defence. - Thank you.

1080
1:59:15,020 --> 1:59:16,850
好吧
Well...

1081
1:59:18,520 --> 1:59:21,270
没有人能再否认利斯贝思是受害者
No one can deny any longer that Lisbeth was the victim...

1082
1:59:21,520 --> 1:59:27,400
被她的监护人尼尔斯·比约曼律师严重性侵
...of serious sexual abuse by her guardian, advocate Nils Bjurman.

1083
1:59:27,610 --> 1:59:31,120
一个她认为她可以信任的人
A person she thought that she could trust.

1084
1:59:32,790 --> 1:59:38,620
正如我已经说过的 它说明了对利斯贝思的攻击类型
As I have said, it illustrates the type of assaults against Lisbeth.

1085
1:59:39,880 --> 1:59:44,420
这些攻击既是心理上的 也是司法上的
The attacks have been both psychological and judicial.

1086
1:59:45,670 --> 1:59:51,680
对此负有主要责任的人是彼得·泰尔博里安博士
The person who bears a major responsibility for this, is Dr. Peter Teleborian.

1087
1:59:53,010 --> 1:59:56,890
1993年 他写了一份精神病学报告
In 1993 he has written a psychiatric report...

1088
1:59:57,060 --> 2:00:02,520
和冈纳·比约克一起
...together with Gunnar Björck...

1089
2:00:02,690 --> 2:00:06,280
他是安全局内部一个非法组织的成员
... - who was a member of an illegal group inside the Security Service..

1090
2:00:06,440 --> 2:00:11,660
为了让一个危险的证人闭嘴
...in order to silence a dangerous witness...

1091
2:00:11,820 --> 2:00:18,040
就这样 莉斯贝丝·萨兰德被关进了一个安全的精神病室
...and thus Lisbeth Salander got locked up in a secure psychiatric unit.

1092
2:00:18,210 --> 2:00:22,170
这些指控一定是有限度的
There must be a limit to these allegations...

1093
2:00:22,340 --> 2:00:24,920
打扰一下 现在 我请你发言
Excuse me, but now l have the floor.

1094
2:00:25,960 --> 2:00:29,420
这发生在丽斯贝丝向她父亲浇了汽油之后
This happened after Lisbeth had poured petrol on her father...

1095
2:00:29,590 --> 2:00:35,100
亚历山大·萨拉琴科绝望地试图救她的母亲
...Alexander Zalachenko, in a desperate attempt to save her mother.

1096
2:00:36,470 --> 2:00:39,430
但那些保护萨拉琴科的人
But those who protected Zalachenko...

1097
2:00:39,600 --> 2:00:44,310
确保掩盖这件事 并对调查进行保密
...made sure to cover it up and classified the investigations.

1098
2:00:44,480 --> 2:00:48,990
在彼得·泰尔博里安的帮助下
And with Peter Teleborian's help...

1099
2:00:49,240 --> 2:00:53,490
他们把莉斯贝丝囚禁在乌普萨拉的圣斯蒂芬医院
...they imprisoned Lisbeth at St. Stephen's Hospital in Uppsala.

1100
2:00:53,700 --> 2:00:56,740
这是一项无耻的指控
That's an outrageous accusation!

1101
2:00:56,990 --> 2:01:02,370
我试着从各个方面帮助莉斯贝丝·萨兰德她试图
I have tried to help Lisbeth Salander in every way. She attempted...

1102
2:01:02,580 --> 2:01:08,130
昨天 彼得·泰尔博里安提交了他的新的法医精神病学报告
Yesterday Peter Teleborian presented his new forensic psychiatric report.

1103
2:01:08,340 --> 2:01:10,380
再一次 他提议
Once again, he proposes..

1104
2:01:10,630 --> 2:01:15,010
强制拘留和监禁利斯贝丝·萨兰德
...compulsory detention and imprisonment of Lisbeth Salander.

1105
2:01:15,640 --> 2:01:18,970
但就像1993年一样 这也是一件赝品
But just like in 1993 this is also a forgery.

1106
2:01:19,230 --> 2:01:20,890
这完全是
That is completely...

1107
2:01:21,100 --> 2:01:25,770
我必须请你允许辩方完成她的发言
l must ask you to allow the defence to finish her speech!

1108
2:01:30,360 --> 2:01:32,280
谢谢
Thank you.

1109
2:01:35,990 --> 2:01:41,160
他的观点是基于我当事人的 观察 
His opinion is based on the "observation" of my client.

1110
2:01:43,920 --> 2:01:48,420
那一定是在她被转移到克罗诺贝格监狱后发生的
That must have happened after she was transferred to Kronoberg prison...

1111
2:01:48,670 --> 2:01:53,630
10月6日 11月5日完成
...on October 6, and completed on November 5.

1112
2:01:54,680 --> 2:01:57,680
对吗 彼得·泰尔博里安
ls that correct, Peter Teleborian?

1113
2:02:02,390 --> 2:02:04,440
我想传唤两名证人
l would like to call in two witnesses.

1114
2:02:10,940 --> 2:02:13,070
不是的
No!

1115
2:02:21,580 --> 2:02:24,210
警察 放下武器
Police! Drop your weapon!

1116
2:02:28,920 --> 2:02:32,670
好吧 你知道这份文件吗
Well... do you know this document?

1117
2:02:37,720 --> 2:02:39,680
是
Yes.

1118
2:02:41,220 --> 2:02:46,940
这是彼得·泰尔博里安写的关于丽斯贝丝·萨兰德的精神病学报告
lt is the psychiatric report on Lisbeth Salander by Peter Teleborian.

1119
2:02:48,480 --> 2:02:51,440
有三个版本
There are three versions.

1120
2:02:51,610 --> 2:02:56,360
第一张日期是9月20日 第二张是10月1日
The first dated September 20, the second October 1 ...

1121
2:02:56,610 --> 2:03:00,740
这是第三张 日期是10月6日
...and this one is the third, dated October 6.

1122
2:03:01,740 --> 2:03:04,620
你把文件给了我
You gave me the documents.

1123
2:03:04,870 --> 2:03:09,630
我注意到 10月1日的第一份报告
And I have noticed that the first report of October 1 ...

1124
2:03:09,880 --> 2:03:16,220
与彼得·泰尔博里安昨天提交的报告一模一样
...is identical to the report which Peter Teleborian presented yesterday.

1125
2:03:16,380 --> 2:03:19,140
日期为11月5日
Dated November 5.

1126
2:03:19,390 --> 2:03:22,010
说得委婉些 非常奇怪
Very odd, to put it mildly.

1127
2:03:23,140 --> 2:03:27,480
我的结论是彼得·泰尔博里安写了这些报告
My conclusion is that Peter Teleborian has written the reports...

1128
2:03:27,650 --> 2:03:30,900
在他观察利斯贝丝·萨兰德之前
...before he observed Lisbeth Salander.

1129
2:03:32,150 --> 2:03:35,650
出于这个原因 它缺乏所有的可信度
For this reason it lacks all credibility.

1130
2:03:39,240 --> 2:03:41,990
埃德克林警长 这是真的
Superintendent Edklinth, it is true...

1131
2:03:42,160 --> 2:03:47,120
你从Mikael Blomkvist那里收到了关于Salander的这些报告
...that you have received these reports about Salander from Mikael Blomkvist?

1132
2:03:47,290 --> 2:03:48,750
是
Yes.

1133
2:03:48,920 --> 2:03:53,420
你的总体结论是什么 - 它们是错误的
What are your overall conclusions? - They are false.

1134
2:03:54,300 --> 2:03:57,130
它们是很久以前写的
They were written long before...

1135
2:03:57,300 --> 2:04:03,010
彼得·泰尔博里安有机会在监狱里见到丽斯贝丝·萨兰德
...Peter Teleborian had the opportunity to meet Lisbeth Salander in prison.

1136
2:04:03,260 --> 2:04:08,270
此外 它们是在某个乔纳斯·桑德伯格的合作下完成的
Moreover, they were completed with the collaboration of a certain Jonas Sandberg.

1137
2:04:08,440 --> 2:04:10,560
那是瞎说
That's a lie.

1138
2:04:11,650 --> 2:04:14,650
这是谎言吗 - 不 一点也不
Is it a lie? - No, not at all.

1139
2:04:14,820 --> 2:04:18,570
文件上注明了日期 还有电子邮件通信
The documents are dated and there is e - mail correspondence...

1140
