1
0:02:31,800 --> 0:02:34,980
...And them as were still alive, where'd they go?

2
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:38,480
Every which way, like ghosts, on the fields...

3
0:02:38,500 --> 0:02:41,930
By October, the town was deserted.

4
0:02:41,950 --> 0:02:46,180
All you heard was: "Step aside, it's the undertakers!"

5
0:02:46,200 --> 0:02:50,220
They piled them together, dead and plagued.

6
0:02:50,240 --> 0:02:53,290
They tried to gather them from every corner of town

7
0:02:53,320 --> 0:02:57,380
but the dead stayed in the streets'til the undertakers came.

8
0:02:57,400 --> 0:03:00,400
Then they buried them in gardens.

9
0:03:01,930 --> 0:03:05,070
And the fearsome death kept on 'til January.

10
0:03:05,100 --> 0:03:08,450
- Poor souls...  - Great woe for the Christians!

11
0:03:08,470 --> 0:03:11,360
- There was also thieves dressed as undertakers.  - How so?

12
0:03:11,380 --> 0:03:13,080
With a red scarf 'round their necks.

13
0:03:13,090 --> 0:03:17,560
They went around thieving, taking money, silverware...

14
0:03:17,590 --> 0:03:20,580
People fled them like death

15
0:03:20,680 --> 0:03:22,760
for they picked up the ill, too

16
0:03:22,910 --> 0:03:26,140
threw them into the wagon and hit them with a bat over the head.

17
0:03:26,160 --> 0:03:29,100
But worse still were the living abandoned

18
0:03:29,120 --> 0:03:32,630
with no cover on the frozen fields.

19
0:03:32,650 --> 0:03:35,960
All around you heard the screams

20
0:03:35,990 --> 0:03:39,200
of the miserable souls in the fields at Dudesti...

21
0:03:42,520 --> 0:03:44,060
Ah, Christ's blood!

22
0:03:45,310 --> 0:03:47,830
And we, the living,

23
0:03:47,850 --> 0:03:51,080
thought ourselves dead and wandered around, dazed.

24
0:03:53,670 --> 0:03:56,550
WALLACHIA, 1835

25
0:04:33,010 --> 0:04:34,760
Look, Satan's coming!

26
0:04:36,130 --> 0:04:38,730
Oi, aunt, wait!

27
0:04:38,760 --> 0:04:40,230
Good day to you, constable.

28
0:04:40,260 --> 0:04:43,680
As good as your soul! Are you scared?

29
0:04:43,710 --> 0:04:46,020
No.

30
0:04:46,040 --> 0:04:48,160
Good, the clear sky fears not the lightning.

31
0:04:48,170 --> 0:04:49,950
- Who are you?  - A good soul.

32
0:04:49,960 --> 0:04:51,920
We'll see 'bout that.

33
0:04:51,950 --> 0:04:53,590
Whence are you coming?

34
0:04:53,610 --> 0:04:56,700
I'm of Geanache's, Leana by name...

35
0:04:57,820 --> 0:04:59,740
I think I know you.

36
0:05:01,350 --> 0:05:03,520
Where are you going, you hag?

37
0:05:06,730 --> 0:05:10,580
Taking my ol' man to kiss the Virgin's icon.

38
0:05:10,600 --> 0:05:14,610
He is dying and will leave me alone.

39
0:05:14,640 --> 0:05:16,860
- What ails him?  - The fever.

40
0:05:16,890 --> 0:05:21,110
Go away! It could be the cholera! You'll kill us.

41
0:05:21,140 --> 0:05:22,770
You didn't ask.

42
0:05:22,790 --> 0:05:26,520
You should have told us yourself, stupid cow!

43
0:05:26,540 --> 0:05:29,310
I ought to give your fat ass a whipping...

44
0:05:29,330 --> 0:05:30,920
Fuck you, crone!

45
0:05:32,620 --> 0:05:34,180
Did you cross the forest?

46
0:05:34,280 --> 0:05:36,160
Nay, I was afraid.

47
0:05:36,410 --> 0:05:38,470
Are the Gypsy gold panners still in the forest?

48
0:05:38,620 --> 0:05:39,640
I don't know.

49
0:05:40,490 --> 0:05:42,120
Where are you taking your man?

50
0:05:42,150 --> 0:05:45,830
I hope to find a nun to give him some herbs...

51
0:05:45,860 --> 0:05:49,480
She'll give him some bell juice, priest's song...

52
0:05:52,430 --> 0:05:54,240
...and some spade oil.

53
0:05:54,260 --> 0:05:56,220
Out of my sight!

54
0:06:00,600 --> 0:06:02,930
Filthy plague rat...

55
0:06:03,220 --> 0:06:04,650
Barefoot hag...

56
0:06:31,070 --> 0:06:33,020
We have business with the abbot.

57
0:06:33,120 --> 0:06:34,090
What business?

58
0:06:34,850 --> 0:06:37,050
A secret from boyar Candescu.

59
0:06:38,310 --> 0:06:40,010
Father Superior!

60
0:06:58,240 --> 0:07:01,700
The poor prays more than the rich

61
0:07:01,960 --> 0:07:03,110
because he has time.

62
0:07:15,180 --> 0:07:17,310
Lord be with us!

63
0:07:32,160 --> 0:07:33,890
Good day, bright lord.

64
0:07:33,910 --> 0:07:36,050
The constable is here for some enquiries.

65
0:07:36,080 --> 0:07:39,050
If you know anything, speak up.

66
0:07:39,080 --> 0:07:40,230
How many souls here?

67
0:07:40,430 --> 0:07:43,190
Thirty souls. Ten died...

68
0:07:43,440 --> 0:07:44,540
Who's Carfin's sister?

69
0:07:44,730 --> 0:07:45,750
Me, bright lord.

70
0:07:46,860 --> 0:07:49,350
- 他在哪里  - 我不知道

71
0:07:49,360 --> 0:07:52,800
Haven't seen him since I was sold to the monastery here...

72
0:07:52,810 --> 0:07:54,130
- You don't know, eh?!  - I don't!

73
0:07:54,160 --> 0:07:55,290
Tell him!

74
0:07:55,380 --> 0:07:58,850
Stay out of it, that's my craft.

75
0:08:00,060 --> 0:08:00,730
Crow, what's your name?

76
0:08:00,970 --> 0:08:01,890
Pena.

77
0:08:01,960 --> 0:08:04,930
Want to taste this whip?

78
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:07,690
Sure I don't.

79
0:08:07,770 --> 0:08:10,760
Where is he, filthy whore?

80
0:08:10,840 --> 0:08:16,260
Tell me, or I'll whip all you slaves to death!

81
0:08:20,040 --> 0:08:20,730
Where is he?

82
0:08:20,800 --> 0:08:22,050
We don't know nothing, sir.

83
0:08:22,130 --> 0:08:23,760
I'll give you a silver coin.

84
0:08:23,860 --> 0:08:24,850
We don't know.

85
0:08:26,570 --> 0:08:30,920
The monks beats us all the time, but we don't know.

86
0:08:31,190 --> 0:08:31,820
Say what?

87
0:08:31,900 --> 0:08:32,920
Said we don't know!

88
0:08:33,030 --> 0:08:34,730
He went to the gold panners.

89
0:08:35,630 --> 0:08:36,660
How do you know?

90
0:08:36,730 --> 0:08:38,100
He told me when we were sowing.

91
0:08:38,200 --> 0:08:41,220
Said there's more freedom there.

92
0:08:42,930 --> 0:08:43,760
Fine.

93
0:08:44,030 --> 0:08:45,030
Merciful lord, the coin!

94
0:08:45,030 --> 0:08:49,330
Fuck off, crows! You'll get the coin when I find him.

95
0:08:53,270 --> 0:08:55,460
Back to work, crows!

96
0:09:10,740 --> 0:09:12,890
Gypsies, can't change them...

97
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:14,660
Don't we know it?!

98
0:09:15,840 --> 0:09:19,600
Our own good brandy.

99
0:09:20,810 --> 0:09:22,090
Enjoy it.

100
0:09:22,800 --> 0:09:25,170
Worthy of the Wedding at Cana!

101
0:09:25,240 --> 0:09:26,930
Our thanks, Father.

102
0:09:30,510 --> 0:09:31,930
God be with you.

103
0:09:32,500 --> 0:09:34,330
How 'bout a riddle?

104
0:09:34,570 --> 0:09:35,430
Let's hear it.

105
0:09:35,800 --> 0:09:39,170
Lifeless out of life

106
0:09:39,540 --> 0:09:41,760
life out of lifeless.

107
0:09:47,010 --> 0:09:48,700
Doomsday...

108
0:09:49,410 --> 0:09:51,130
No.You say it, Ionita.

109
0:09:51,200 --> 0:09:54,260
The egg,for the hen lays it lifeless,

110
0:09:54,470 --> 0:09:56,960
and when it hatches,it comes to life.

111
0:09:58,210 --> 0:09:59,570
The chicken!

112
0:10:02,800 --> 0:10:04,960
Go with the Lord.

113
0:10:16,610 --> 0:10:19,310
I'm getting lame...

114
0:10:34,740 --> 0:10:36,110
Father, I'm cold.

115
0:10:37,010 --> 0:10:39,810
If you caught that fever, you're fucked.

116
0:10:40,010 --> 0:10:42,560
Cholera morbus,as the big doctors say...

117
0:10:56,850 --> 0:10:58,580
You're such a waste of bread!

118
0:10:58,650 --> 0:11:01,040
How's he going to be an officer?

119
0:11:01,370 --> 0:11:04,340
If you slap him, he'll die of grief.

120
0:11:04,780 --> 0:11:05,770
Ain't that you?

121
0:11:05,880 --> 0:11:06,940
No, t'aint.

122
0:11:07,620 --> 0:11:09,550
Watch your mouth.

123
0:11:09,650 --> 0:11:11,940
Honour thy mother and father,as the Gospel says,

124
0:11:12,110 --> 0:11:14,600
for a father weighs more than twelve children...

125
0:11:14,810 --> 0:11:16,180
Sure I honour you.

126
0:11:17,110 --> 0:11:20,240
Stab the enemy like a man!

127
0:11:21,440 --> 0:11:23,910
This is a sword from Ianina,show some respect!

128
0:11:32,350 --> 0:11:35,510
Not bad, the priest's brandy! Cures any sickness.

129
0:11:35,580 --> 0:11:37,380
- Try some.- Don't want to.

130
0:11:37,450 --> 0:11:39,080
Drink like a man!

131
0:11:39,950 --> 0:11:42,880
You don't taste good brandy,you down it.

132
0:11:52,410 --> 0:11:54,510
Crush those Russians!

133
0:12:14,180 --> 0:12:16,810
Look at all those lazy crows.

134
0:12:25,020 --> 0:12:26,140
Where are you going?

135
0:12:38,730 --> 0:12:40,090
Get him, Ionita!

136
0:12:47,790 --> 0:12:49,260
Stop or I shoot!

137
0:12:54,820 --> 0:12:56,750
Carfin, you fucking bastard!

138
0:13:01,190 --> 0:13:05,140
I didn't steal nothing, bright lord.

139
0:13:05,720 --> 0:13:08,490
Back off, crows!

140
0:13:10,790 --> 0:13:14,220
He didn't do nothin'! Don't kill him!

141
0:13:14,490 --> 0:13:16,890
Spare him his life!

142
0:13:16,960 --> 0:13:18,320
Stay out, or I'll kill you too!

143
0:13:21,990 --> 0:13:22,890
Is he from your camp?

144
0:13:22,960 --> 0:13:25,790
He's our Caldasin.

145
0:13:25,860 --> 0:13:26,620
Why'd you run?

146
0:13:26,690 --> 0:13:28,160
For fear, bright lord.

147
0:13:28,660 --> 0:13:29,630
Can you read?

148
0:13:29,700 --> 0:13:30,560
I can't.

149
0:13:33,020 --> 0:13:33,920
Here!

150
0:13:41,850 --> 0:13:43,380
Don't drop it.

151
0:13:45,460 --> 0:13:48,730
"...to you, lawkeeper Costandin sin Gheorghe,

152
0:13:48,800 --> 0:13:52,090
this letter gives all power

153
0:13:52,220 --> 0:13:56,090
to catch the Gypsy slave Carfin Pandoleon:

154
0:13:56,230 --> 0:14:06,620
tall of stature, dark of face,

155
0:14:06,730 --> 0:14:12,920
who also speaks the Gypsy language.

156
0:14:13,130 --> 0:14:23,490
This Gypsy fled from boyar Iordache Candescu

157
0:14:23,560 --> 0:14:28,560
and stole money from a box.

158
0:14:29,870 --> 0:14:38,390
Should you not bring said slave,

159
0:14:38,470 --> 0:14:42,150
we shall put you in chains

160
0:14:42,230 --> 0:14:46,420
and bring upon you great punishment.These we write..."

161
0:14:46,530 --> 0:14:47,590
Enough.

162
0:14:58,570 --> 0:15:00,890
- Nasty language these crows have.  - Yes.

163
0:15:01,900 --> 0:15:04,190
Fit for devils, not people.

164
0:15:12,900 --> 0:15:14,460
He only passed by here.

165
0:15:14,530 --> 0:15:15,620
Where'd he go, then?

166
0:15:15,700 --> 0:15:16,790
Towards Craiova

167
0:15:16,870 --> 0:15:18,960
or to the next county...

168
0:15:19,040 --> 0:15:20,160
When did he leave?

169
0:15:20,240 --> 0:15:23,500
Before sunset, many days ago.

170
0:15:23,670 --> 0:15:25,360
If you lie to me,we'll spill your guts...

171
0:15:25,470 --> 0:15:27,160
I ain't lying, bright lord.

172
0:15:27,240 --> 0:15:29,800
Some bear-taming Gypsies passed by

173
0:15:29,870 --> 0:15:32,830
then your man

174
0:15:33,130 --> 0:15:35,690
My boys gave him some foodand

175
0:15:36,040 --> 0:15:36,930
off he went.

176
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:39,530
If you've been crowing out lies,

177
0:15:39,910 --> 0:15:45,270
we'll come back with the posse and kill you like sparrows.

178
0:15:48,970 --> 0:15:52,960
Bright lord, here's some gold, so you won't leave angry.

179
0:15:56,670 --> 0:16:00,510
Damn you and your gold!

180
0:16:09,110 --> 0:16:11,790
Ionita, this is how you scare the crows,

181
0:16:11,870 --> 0:16:13,960
if you're a man!

182
0:16:14,040 --> 0:16:14,730
Yes.

183
0:16:14,810 --> 0:16:19,300
A good butcher doesn't fear thousands of thousands of sheep!

184
0:16:55,980 --> 0:16:58,100
Fucking bad luck! A priest in skirts.

185
0:16:58,950 --> 0:17:00,530
Ten years of misfortune.

186
0:17:03,710 --> 0:17:04,940
Away, Satan

187
0:17:05,140 --> 0:17:06,110
Why do we do that?

188
0:17:06,210 --> 0:17:08,740
'Cause devils flock around priests.

189
0:17:10,380 --> 0:17:13,540
What happened, honourable Father?

190
0:17:16,080 --> 0:17:19,070
This cursed wheel broke off.

191
0:17:19,250 --> 0:17:22,170
Shall we help, like good Samaritans?

192
0:17:22,910 --> 0:17:26,180
God bless you. The snakes would have swallowed me alive.

193
0:17:26,250 --> 0:17:29,770
God is glad to see two poor souls helping each other.

194
0:17:30,120 --> 0:17:33,510
You have an axe there and all you need.

195
0:17:39,850 --> 0:17:41,310
What are you looking for?

196
0:17:41,510 --> 0:17:44,340
A runaway Gypsy slave who stole the boyar's money.

197
0:17:44,680 --> 0:17:46,480
Damned crow!

198
0:17:47,120 --> 0:17:49,640
I didn't see anyone. So he ran away?

199
0:17:49,750 --> 0:17:53,200
Yes, Father. The crows have no shame anymore.

200
0:17:53,280 --> 0:17:54,800
It'll be the end of us

201
0:17:54,880 --> 0:17:58,150
when the ass gets at the head and the cunt is in command...

202
0:17:58,220 --> 0:17:59,580
True, Father.

203
0:17:59,850 --> 0:18:02,210
I just hope he doesn't run to the Turks.

204
0:18:02,280 --> 0:18:03,510
What could he do there?

205
0:18:03,580 --> 0:18:07,480
He could become a mercenary in Nicopolis.

206
0:18:07,790 --> 0:18:09,810
If he does, we've lost him...

207
0:18:10,910 --> 0:18:12,170
Ready, Father.

208
0:18:13,850 --> 0:18:16,720
God, bless Thy servants, amen!

209
0:18:17,690 --> 0:18:19,210
Have some holy water.

210
0:18:19,660 --> 0:18:23,810
To wash us of our many sins...

211
0:18:24,080 --> 0:18:25,450
Good for you.

212
0:18:25,520 --> 0:18:27,780
As the Ecclesiastes says:

213
0:18:27,850 --> 0:18:31,970
"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,do it with thy might;

214
0:18:32,210 --> 0:18:34,210
for there is no work

215
0:18:34,320 --> 0:18:35,370
nor device,nor knowledge, nor wisdom,

216
0:18:35,490 --> 0:18:37,510
in the grave, where thou goest."

217
0:18:37,720 --> 0:18:42,550
Well said, my sons! Christ did not rise in vain.

218
0:18:42,880 --> 0:18:43,780
So help us God!

219
0:18:47,390 --> 0:18:49,790
I'll spend the night at Manjoala's inn.

220
0:18:50,450 --> 0:18:53,080
I never travel in the dark for fear of outlaws.

221
0:18:53,350 --> 0:18:56,180
As for us,first business, then pleasure:

222
0:18:56,390 --> 0:19:02,110
we'll search 'til the Seven Sisters rise...

223
0:19:07,490 --> 0:19:10,010
Isn't there a holiday coming, Father?

224
0:19:10,330 --> 0:19:12,080
So it is.

225
0:19:12,620 --> 0:19:15,780
Forgive me, Lord! I hanged You with thread,

226
0:19:15,860 --> 0:19:20,580
and not with a gold chain, like the bishops.

227
0:19:21,950 --> 0:19:25,910
But isn't it faith that matters most?

228
0:19:25,990 --> 0:19:28,550
Faith, but also deeds!

229
0:19:31,520 --> 0:19:33,580
Another question, if we may?

230
0:19:33,660 --> 0:19:34,640
Sure.

231
0:19:35,260 --> 0:19:38,750
You're more enlightened, you have praxis...

232
0:19:38,830 --> 0:19:39,560
Sure.

233
0:19:39,630 --> 0:19:45,390
Gypsies, is they people or Satan's spawn?

234
0:19:45,590 --> 0:19:47,120
Some say they ain't human.

235
0:19:47,330 --> 0:19:48,890
Human like us.

236
0:19:48,960 --> 0:19:51,280
Aren't they Christians?

237
0:19:51,620 --> 0:19:54,750
I myself baptised two slave cubs recently.

238
0:19:54,960 --> 0:19:56,050
Monastery slaves?

239
0:19:56,130 --> 0:19:57,790
Right, two chickies.

240
0:19:58,800 --> 0:20:02,880
Crows are descendants of Ham,son of Noah,

241
0:20:03,560 --> 0:20:05,890
cursed by his father to be black.

242
0:20:06,100 --> 0:20:09,260
They came here from Egypt.

243
0:20:09,660 --> 0:20:11,590
They are Egyptians.

244
0:20:11,760 --> 0:20:12,850
Is that so?

245
0:20:12,930 --> 0:20:15,550
Yes. What do we call crows to mock them?

246
0:20:15,630 --> 0:20:17,030
Black crows.

247
0:20:17,100 --> 0:20:19,360
There are no white crows. How else?

248
0:20:19,630 --> 0:20:21,110
Maggots.

249
0:20:21,320 --> 0:20:23,020
- What else?  - Darkies.

250
0:20:23,090 --> 0:20:24,250
Pharaohs.

251
0:20:24,390 --> 0:20:26,490
Good, aferim! Pharaohs

252
0:20:26,600 --> 0:20:30,920
'Cause they came here from Egypt,

253
0:20:31,030 --> 0:20:35,050
where they were also slaves,building palaces for the kings.

254
0:20:35,930 --> 0:20:39,760
When a wise man opens his mouth, open your ears!

255
0:20:39,970 --> 0:20:43,260
Gypsies is humans.Jews ain't.

256
0:20:43,360 --> 0:20:44,220
They's beasts.

257
0:20:44,300 --> 0:20:45,660
If you say so...

258
0:20:46,060 --> 0:20:51,320
Now you tell me,why is Jews not human?

259
0:20:51,460 --> 0:20:53,830
'Cause Jews drinks the blood of Christian children.

260
0:20:53,900 --> 0:20:55,590
The priest told us so in church.

261
0:20:55,700 --> 0:21:00,030
And why do they?

262
0:21:00,100 --> 0:21:01,120
We don't know.

263
0:21:01,330 --> 0:21:03,390
Have you heard of the Giant Jews?

264
0:21:03,500 --> 0:21:04,330
No.

265
0:21:04,400 --> 0:21:06,800
Shame on you...

266
0:21:06,900 --> 0:21:12,730
Before making mankind,God created the Giant Jews.

267
0:21:12,830 --> 0:21:14,850
Mean, ugly giants.

268
0:21:15,030 --> 0:21:19,160
He saw His mistake and turned them into dust.

269
0:21:19,400 --> 0:21:24,130
He left just a few,then made Adam and Eve.

270
0:21:24,330 --> 0:21:30,490
The Giant Jews multiplied,but grew ever smaller.

271
0:21:30,800 --> 0:21:33,770
They's our Jews nowadays.

272
0:21:33,830 --> 0:21:35,200
We didn't know that.

273
0:21:35,370 --> 0:21:38,270
That's why Jews can't stand us Christians,

274
0:21:38,470 --> 0:21:40,830
that's why they killed Christ.

275
0:21:40,900 --> 0:21:42,420
And that's why I can't stand them.

276
0:21:42,500 --> 0:21:44,590
Do you know what I do with pork-haters?

277
0:21:44,670 --> 0:21:45,330
We don't.

278
0:21:45,400 --> 0:21:48,430
I cut off their beards and sidelocks.

279
0:21:48,510 --> 0:21:51,260
Better a Jew without a beard than a beard without a Jew!

280
0:21:51,330 --> 0:21:53,090
Do you know what they do in Moldova?

281
0:21:53,170 --> 0:21:54,830
I don't know...

282
0:21:54,900 --> 0:22:00,170
Jews walk around in their carriages.

283
0:22:00,230 --> 0:22:02,260
And instead of horses

284
0:22:02,330 --> 0:22:05,730
they use good Christians.

285
0:22:05,800 --> 0:22:08,740
I don't believe it, father.That's what the Russians did to us.

286
0:22:08,810 --> 0:22:10,420
In the war of 1828,

287
0:22:10,500 --> 0:22:12,930
General Zaltukhin harnessed our peasants...

288
0:22:13,000 --> 0:22:15,840
The Christians in my cousin's village

289
0:22:15,940 --> 0:22:18,500
can't bleed themselves

290
0:22:18,610 --> 0:22:21,900
the Jews left no leeches in the lake.

291
0:22:21,970 --> 0:22:27,000
But some Jews are baptised into our Christian faith.

292
0:22:27,110 --> 0:22:28,840
Who would believe those outlaws?

293
0:22:28,940 --> 0:22:30,920
"Who makes up the Devil's flocks? "

294
0:22:31,000 --> 0:22:33,060
"All the Jews with their sidelocks."

295
0:22:34,260 --> 0:22:36,860
Each nation has its purpose.

296
0:22:37,170 --> 0:22:39,630
The Jews, to cheat

297
0:22:39,700 --> 0:22:41,190
the Turks, to do harm,

298
0:22:41,300 --> 0:22:44,020
us Romanians to love, honour

299
0:22:44,130 --> 0:22:45,760
and suffer like good Christians.

300
0:22:45,830 --> 0:22:47,630
And each has their habits.

301
0:22:47,740 --> 0:22:49,670
Hebrews reads a lot

302
0:22:49,740 --> 0:22:51,140
Greeks talks a lot,

303
0:22:51,210 --> 0:22:52,370
Turks has many wives,

304
0:22:52,470 --> 0:22:53,950
Arabs has many teeth,

305
0:22:54,030 --> 0:22:55,500
Germans smokes a lot

306
0:22:55,570 --> 0:22:56,860
Hungarians eats a lot

307
0:22:56,970 --> 0:22:59,940
Russians drinks a lot,English thinks a lot,

308
0:23:00,010 --> 0:23:03,760
French like fashion a lot,Armenians are lazy,

309
0:23:03,830 --> 0:23:06,320
Circasians wears many a lace,

310
0:23:06,400 --> 0:23:09,700
Italians lies a lot,

311
0:23:09,810 --> 0:23:11,310
Serbians cheats a lot.

312
0:23:11,310 --> 0:23:13,390
and Gypsies get many a beating

313
0:23:13,600 --> 0:23:15,260
Gypsies must be slaves.

314
0:23:15,340 --> 0:23:18,460
When Ham spread horse shit on Noah,

315
0:23:18,540 --> 0:23:19,840
Noah cursed them to be slaves

316
0:23:19,940 --> 0:23:20,930
and as dark as shit.

317
0:23:21,010 --> 0:23:21,940
That's right.

318
0:23:22,380 --> 0:23:25,890
They must be kept on a tight leash.'Tis a holy commandment.

319
0:23:25,970 --> 0:23:30,070
But with kindness.That is my habit.

320
0:23:32,010 --> 0:23:33,100
Though I'm as harsh as a hot pepper

321
0:23:33,170 --> 0:23:35,830
born of father Garlic and mother Onion.

322
0:23:37,270 --> 0:23:40,100
I treat people kindly.

323
0:23:40,780 --> 0:23:43,790
The Gospel says to be as gentle as doves, Father...

324
0:23:43,870 --> 0:23:47,630
If the beasts weren't vanquished,

325
0:23:47,740 --> 0:23:50,040
they would tear man apart.

326
0:23:50,110 --> 0:23:53,370
Even among people,most are beasts

327
0:23:53,440 --> 0:23:57,400
who must be tamed to make them work.

328
0:23:57,480 --> 0:23:59,270
Particularly the crows.

329
0:23:59,740 --> 0:24:01,370
Lovely thoughts, Father.

330
0:24:09,340 --> 0:24:11,280
We'll head this way.

331
0:24:13,340 --> 0:24:14,930
We wish you good health.

332
0:24:15,480 --> 0:24:18,240
Good health to bear good grief.

333
0:24:18,240 --> 0:24:20,400
Go with God, we may meet again.

334
0:24:20,480 --> 0:24:22,780
The mountains themselves sometimes meet...

335
0:24:23,590 --> 0:24:25,750
True words.

336
0:25:08,780 --> 0:25:11,220
Even a fallen tree rests...

337
0:25:37,720 --> 0:25:39,480
It's not true, Ionita.

338
0:25:40,690 --> 0:25:41,710
You could walk until you die

339
0:25:41,820 --> 0:25:43,800
and still not touch the end of the Earth.

340
0:25:44,650 --> 0:25:46,770
That's what the priest told us:

341
0:25:46,880 --> 0:25:49,320
that the Earth has an edge,it ain't endless.

342
0:25:49,390 --> 0:25:53,280
Those are just a fool's teachings.

343
0:25:54,680 --> 0:25:59,140
Father Duhu told us everything has an end but for God,

344
0:25:59,290 --> 0:26:01,810
who has neither beginning, nor end.

345
0:26:02,360 --> 0:26:04,340
Doesn't the Earth have an end?

346
0:26:04,720 --> 0:26:07,310
Where it ends, ain't it like a precipice?

347
0:26:08,950 --> 0:26:11,980
I don't know.'Tain't any of my concern.

348
0:26:13,880 --> 0:26:16,320
I have other worries.

349
0:26:19,490 --> 0:26:21,250
We're nothing, Ionita.

350
0:26:22,630 --> 0:26:25,020
Look at the size of this world...

351
0:26:26,550 --> 0:26:29,950
...we're like a spark from these embers.

352
0:26:34,120 --> 0:26:35,880
Do you know the seven planets?

353
0:26:36,790 --> 0:26:38,780
The Moon, the Sun...

354
0:26:38,860 --> 0:26:43,640
Bottle, Flask, Pitcher, Mug, Carafe, Jar, and Stein.

355
0:26:48,460 --> 0:26:53,780
Here I lay and die,No help by my side.

356
0:26:55,160 --> 0:26:59,150
Far as I may seek,My fate remains bleak.

357
0:26:59,690 --> 0:27:04,350
Life of grief and sorrow, No hope for tomorrow.

358
0:27:04,420 --> 0:27:07,050
Some have luck, fortune and fame,

359
0:27:08,560 --> 0:27:11,190
Some burn like the candle's flame!

360
0:27:13,290 --> 0:27:14,410
What's gotten into you?

361
0:27:41,570 --> 0:27:44,040
Do you like Aspra?

362
0:27:44,620 --> 0:27:46,520
She's a hard-working girl...

363
0:27:46,890 --> 0:27:49,420
How could I like that slob?

364
0:27:49,630 --> 0:27:51,820
You know, as a girl.

365
0:27:52,100 --> 0:27:54,920
Nah, I don't like her.

366
0:27:55,090 --> 0:27:56,390
You're not a Sodomite, are you?

367
0:27:56,860 --> 0:27:57,660
What's that?

368
0:27:57,730 --> 0:27:59,700
Liking men, not women...

369
0:27:59,760 --> 0:28:00,320
No such thing.

370
0:28:00,400 --> 0:28:01,330
'Cause if you are,

371
0:28:01,400 --> 0:28:03,090
I'll drown you with my own hands.

372
0:28:04,530 --> 0:28:05,550
What's that?

373
0:28:20,370 --> 0:28:21,330
The haidouks!

374
0:28:24,500 --> 0:28:25,790
Or the savage Gypsies.

375
0:28:25,860 --> 0:28:29,700
There's also bullet wounds. It was the haidouks.

376
0:28:30,230 --> 0:28:31,330
Let's make way.

377
0:28:37,270 --> 0:28:39,890
- Father...  - Keep that mouth shut!

378
0:28:40,770 --> 0:28:44,220
- One was breathing.  - Sure he was.

379
0:28:44,300 --> 0:28:45,350
He moved just now.

380
0:28:45,900 --> 0:28:48,090
What are we, surgeons?

381
0:28:49,570 --> 0:28:51,590
May he rest in peace.

382
0:29:03,560 --> 0:29:04,860
We're safe.

383
0:29:06,370 --> 0:29:07,990
Fear is shameful, but healthy.

384
0:29:08,070 --> 0:29:09,660
It's God's gift.

385
0:29:49,680 --> 0:29:54,030
You whore's son, watch where you're going!

386
0:29:54,440 --> 0:29:58,740
Is this your own path? Stay the hell in a row!

387
0:29:58,810 --> 0:30:00,540
Fuck your mother!

388
0:30:00,610 --> 0:30:04,190
Find a dog to fuck you, moron!

389
0:30:04,270 --> 0:30:06,930
The rich man is like a hare,

390
0:30:07,240 --> 0:30:08,760
he leaps wherever he wants to.

391
0:30:08,840 --> 0:30:11,610
Maybe a big landowner or a Greek boyar.

392
0:30:11,680 --> 0:30:13,630
Still, he should watch where he's going.

393
0:30:13,740 --> 0:30:16,760
That's our fate as Romanians!

394
0:30:16,840 --> 0:30:20,070
Whoever rises earliest can drag you by your hair.

395
0:30:21,450 --> 0:30:25,000
May he live three more days, counting yesterday!

396
0:30:36,380 --> 0:30:38,040
So pretty!

397
0:30:39,980 --> 0:30:42,240
Fuck your prettiness!

398
0:31:13,680 --> 0:31:14,660
Peace to you, good fellow.

399
0:31:14,780 --> 0:31:15,740
Good day.

400
0:31:16,250 --> 0:31:19,740
We're looking for a runaway crow, a Gypsy slave.

401
0:31:19,850 --> 0:31:22,370
I'm a peasant here, but I ain' seen nobody.

402
0:31:22,520 --> 0:31:23,500
You ain't gonna find him.

403
0:31:23,580 --> 0:31:28,240
Like they didn't find the runaways from our monastery.

404
0:31:28,780 --> 0:31:30,250
Would you sell us some fish?

405
0:31:30,250 --> 0:31:33,610
Why not?

406
0:31:34,640 --> 0:31:37,270
Maybe he's in the forest, with the gold panners.

407
0:31:37,350 --> 0:31:38,110
He ain't.

408
0:31:38,580 --> 0:31:39,780
Then I don't know, constable.

409
0:31:39,850 --> 0:31:40,870
But the monks would have seen him here.

410
0:31:42,710 --> 0:31:47,170
I think so too. Is there a way across through the reeds?

411
0:31:47,320 --> 0:31:49,180
They's too thick.

412
0:31:49,250 --> 0:31:50,180
What if we go around?

413
0:31:50,250 --> 0:31:51,480
- Two days.  - Too long.

414
0:31:51,550 --> 0:31:52,610
Look at this!

415
0:31:55,480 --> 0:31:58,010
Constable, the money?

416
0:32:05,610 --> 0:32:08,450
That's very little, constable.

417
0:32:08,520 --> 0:32:11,580
It ain't worth more.

418
0:32:11,650 --> 0:32:14,610
Come on... constable...

419
0:32:24,350 --> 0:32:26,840
We can cross, the water is shallow.

420
0:32:33,950 --> 0:32:36,470
Curse this wretched craft!

421
0:32:37,990 --> 0:32:40,960
Crawling along, mocked by everyone.

422
0:32:42,980 --> 0:32:45,210
This is a dog's life.

423
0:32:46,490 --> 0:32:50,580
We sweat like beasts for a piece of bread.

424
0:32:55,490 --> 0:32:58,580
If I had had the luck of joining this new army...

425
0:32:59,420 --> 0:33:00,890
- n't they take you in now?

426
0:33:01,190 --> 0:33:03,050
No, curse them...

427
0:33:05,590 --> 0:33:09,550
But if you learn all the tricks of the constable job from me,

428
0:33:11,230 --> 0:33:14,880
I'll get you into the army.

429
0:33:15,760 --> 0:33:17,520
Let's go back, we can't pass.

430
0:33:18,460 --> 0:33:21,450
By thirty you'll be a colonel.

431
0:33:22,260 --> 0:33:24,180
You're full of fire and fierce.

432
0:33:25,490 --> 0:33:26,580
But you're also lazy...

433
0:33:26,660 --> 0:33:27,920
No, I ain't.

434
0:33:27,990 --> 0:33:33,010
You have to be quick like gunpowder.

435
0:33:56,430 --> 0:33:59,220
Who are you?

436
0:33:59,530 --> 0:34:01,500
I'm lawkeeper Costandin sin Gheorghe.

437
0:34:01,560 --> 0:34:03,350
He's my boy, he helps me.

438
0:34:03,420 --> 0:34:04,860
What's your business here?

439
0:34:04,920 --> 0:34:07,590
We're looking for a runaway Gypsy.

440
0:34:07,700 --> 0:34:08,390
What Gypsy?

441
0:34:10,200 --> 0:34:11,720
Where's your mandate?

442
0:34:15,860 --> 0:34:18,950
No good, it's not from our ruler.

443
0:34:19,330 --> 0:34:21,490
I didn't find the Gypsy in my county...

444
0:34:22,340 --> 0:34:23,990
This is Dumbrava county.

445
0:34:24,260 --> 0:34:27,290
I give the orders here.

446
0:34:27,700 --> 0:34:29,990
You get me a mandate, and I'll seek him for you.

447
0:34:30,070 --> 0:34:32,120
What if I get one from your ruler?

448
0:34:32,200 --> 0:34:33,520
We'll see then.

449
0:34:34,830 --> 0:34:39,630
Come on, we're two good lawmen...

450
0:34:39,700 --> 0:34:41,290
Go back!

451
0:34:41,370 --> 0:34:42,330
Come over here.

452
0:34:42,400 --> 0:34:43,190
What for?

453
0:34:43,260 --> 0:34:44,620
Let's have a word.

454
0:34:51,000 --> 0:34:52,690
What would it take for us to agree?

455
0:34:54,130 --> 0:34:55,190
You say.

456
0:34:56,130 --> 0:34:59,660
I give you two thalers and you let me look for him.

457
0:34:59,900 --> 0:35:02,660
These are hard times, bey-mu...

458
0:35:02,890 --> 0:35:06,300
The Russians struck at us, too...

459
0:35:06,370 --> 0:35:07,420
How much, then?

460
0:35:07,970 --> 0:35:12,990
Four thalers, and I'll even tell you where the crow's hiding.

461
0:35:14,030 --> 0:35:16,760
- Where is he, then?  - Money first, bey-mu.

462
0:35:27,170 --> 0:35:27,960
Four.

463
0:35:28,170 --> 0:35:34,460
He's in the house of an ugly man, Stan sin Paraschiv by name.

464
0:35:34,530 --> 0:35:35,290
He's a basket weaver.

465
0:35:35,370 --> 0:35:36,590
How do I find him?

466
0:35:37,470 --> 0:35:42,130
Go back, past some hovels,

467
0:35:42,370 --> 0:35:46,390
then you'll see a house by the pond.

468
0:35:46,670 --> 0:35:49,760
Thanks a-plenty. We're sick of chasing this crow,

469
0:35:50,370 --> 0:35:52,000
I'm also sick and coughing...

470
0:35:52,380 --> 0:35:53,830
No scandal, bey-mu.

471
0:35:54,030 --> 0:35:56,330
'Pon my honour! I'm a constable too!

472
0:35:56,440 --> 0:35:58,560
You haven't heard it from me.

473
0:35:58,640 --> 0:35:59,870
If we don't know the miserable life we lead,

474
0:35:59,940 --> 0:36:01,070
who does?

475
0:36:03,330 --> 0:36:05,060
I'm in your debt.

476
0:36:05,140 --> 0:36:07,070
If you need anything else, ask for me.

477
0:36:07,410 --> 0:36:09,600
Many thanks.

478
0:36:47,310 --> 0:36:49,210
Go see why that hag ran off.

479
0:37:13,610 --> 0:37:16,070
...I'll crack your head open with my yatagan.

480
0:37:16,180 --> 0:37:18,170
There's nothing here.

481
0:37:18,780 --> 0:37:20,010
Get the hell away!

482
0:37:51,990 --> 0:37:53,600
A constable is here!

483
0:37:55,080 --> 0:37:57,100
Bright lords, what is your need?

484
0:37:57,210 --> 0:38:00,770
Good day, aunt,we're looking for Stan sin Paraschiv.

485
0:38:00,850 --> 0:38:02,830
- What for?  - We have a word with him.

486
0:38:02,910 --> 0:38:05,170
- What word?  - A joke.

487
0:38:05,250 --> 0:38:05,800
A joke.

488
0:38:08,020 --> 0:38:10,580
Oi, you're crushing me!

489
0:38:13,050 --> 0:38:14,270
What are you looking for?

490
0:38:31,490 --> 0:38:33,450
You're ruining our reed!

491
0:38:36,650 --> 0:38:39,310
Good man Stan Burned down the barn...

492
0:38:39,620 --> 0:38:42,600
What do you want with me, constable?

493
0:38:42,720 --> 0:38:44,580
I am lawkeeper Costandin sin Gheorghe.

494
0:38:44,650 --> 0:38:47,640
We're here to seize Carfin,the Gypsy slave in your house.

495
0:38:48,190 --> 0:38:49,620
Here's our mandate.

496
0:38:50,860 --> 0:38:52,710
He's my son.

497
0:38:54,120 --> 0:38:57,780
I can't afford Gypsies.

498
0:38:57,850 --> 0:38:59,720
What am I, a boyar?

499
0:38:59,790 --> 0:39:02,370
We break our backs working for nothing.

500
0:39:02,450 --> 0:39:04,710
How could we own Gypsies?

501
0:39:04,790 --> 0:39:05,880
We know he's here.

502
0:39:05,950 --> 0:39:08,080
- Who?  - The crow.

503
0:39:08,320 --> 0:39:09,120
What crow?

504
0:39:09,190 --> 0:39:12,060
Boyar Candescu's Gypsy.

505
0:39:12,250 --> 0:39:15,050
We have no such boyar around here.

506
0:39:15,120 --> 0:39:17,750
He's playing the idiot, isn't he, Ionita?

507
0:39:17,820 --> 0:39:18,790
He is.

508
0:39:19,090 --> 0:39:20,950
- Me, playing the idiot?  - Yes.

509
0:39:21,260 --> 0:39:23,080
- Me, having a Gypsy here?  - Yes.

510
0:39:23,650 --> 0:39:28,590
I tell him I'm a nun and he takes off my habit...

511
0:39:28,660 --> 0:39:30,750
- I don't have any!  - Yes, you do.

512
0:39:31,160 --> 0:39:34,920
Good Lord, where is he, then?

513
0:39:34,990 --> 0:39:36,580
Wherever you hid him.

514
0:39:36,660 --> 0:39:39,020
Should I put the Lord's whip on your back?!

515
0:39:39,320 --> 0:39:43,550
Do you see any Gypsy? A pig it's all we have.

516
0:39:43,620 --> 0:39:48,020
No Gypsy! This is a poor household.

517
0:39:48,090 --> 0:39:50,490
It doesn't look that poor.

518
0:39:51,390 --> 0:39:55,340
We're dirt poor, we only have the skin on our backs.

519
0:39:57,360 --> 0:40:00,090
You still have the fortune between your legs!

520
0:40:00,260 --> 0:40:01,520
Bless you!

521
0:40:06,860 --> 0:40:10,160
Diddle, diddle, the cat and the fiddle!

522
0:40:10,230 --> 0:40:12,350
Let's play piggy in the middle!

523
0:40:13,420 --> 0:40:15,150
Just a little neighbourhood crow.

524
0:40:15,220 --> 0:40:16,480
Let's search some more.

525
0:40:32,220 --> 0:40:34,820
See? No one here.

526
0:40:35,060 --> 0:40:41,690
My daughter-in-law, old Grandpa on his deathbed.

527
0:40:41,770 --> 0:40:44,450
Woman, bring a candle!

528
0:40:44,530 --> 0:40:47,860
- What's here?  - Never seen an attic before?

529
0:40:47,930 --> 0:40:56,220
Where we keep our baskets, beans, onion...

530
0:40:56,330 --> 0:40:59,760
Where do you think you're climbing?

531
0:41:01,640 --> 0:41:03,490
Are you hitting a lawkeeper?

532
0:41:13,460 --> 0:41:16,430
He's killed me!

533
0:41:27,900 --> 0:41:30,730
Father!

534
0:41:30,940 --> 0:41:33,120
He's killin' me!

535
0:41:47,840 --> 0:41:51,630
Let him go!

536
0:41:56,200 --> 0:41:58,960
I'll buy him from you!

537
0:42:21,310 --> 0:42:23,090
Help, they's killin' me!

538
0:42:29,570 --> 0:42:31,400
Stay away or I shoot!

539
0:42:33,620 --> 0:42:35,280
It ain't me. Let me go!

540
0:42:40,680 --> 0:42:44,410
Let him go, he's Stan's slave!

541
0:42:59,950 --> 0:43:01,310
Where are you from, blackie?

542
0:43:01,410 --> 0:43:04,980
Master Iancu the merchant.

543
0:43:05,450 --> 0:43:06,710
Ran away from there?

544
0:43:06,850 --> 0:43:09,750
Yes, master, 'cause he beat me bad.

545
0:43:10,110 --> 0:43:16,950
And he stabbed my brother to death when he was drunk.

546
0:43:17,290 --> 0:43:20,180
I got scared and I ran.

547
0:43:20,280 --> 0:43:21,270
What's your name?

548
0:43:21,380 --> 0:43:22,850
Tintiric, master.

549
0:43:22,920 --> 0:43:23,850
How old are you?

550
0:43:23,920 --> 0:43:25,720
How should I know?

551
0:43:25,890 --> 0:43:27,120
Hasn't anyone told you?

552
0:43:27,220 --> 0:43:28,520
No, master.

553
0:43:28,890 --> 0:43:31,110
Stop shaking like a hag's teeth, are you scared?

554
0:43:31,220 --> 0:43:32,610
Yes, master.

555
0:43:37,420 --> 0:43:38,720
Shut up!

556
0:43:39,560 --> 0:43:40,540
What's the matter?

557
0:43:40,820 --> 0:43:42,220
This shitskin wanted to flee.

558
0:43:42,290 --> 0:43:44,050
I didn't.

559
0:43:44,050 --> 0:43:44,950
You wanted to jump off.

560
0:43:44,950 --> 0:43:45,820
I didn't.

561
0:43:45,890 --> 0:43:48,860
We're taking him back.

562
0:43:49,130 --> 0:43:52,550
The merchant might thank us with a dime or two.

563
0:43:52,620 --> 0:43:54,550
Don't take me back!

564
0:43:54,620 --> 0:43:56,650
Upon my life, master. He'll beat me!

565
0:43:56,720 --> 0:43:59,190
Shut up, little prince,or I'll smack you.

566
0:43:59,260 --> 0:44:02,010
Father, he's just a poor soul!

567
0:44:02,090 --> 0:44:05,890
A devil's soul... But the devil can bring in money, too.

568
0:44:05,960 --> 0:44:07,360
Right.

569
0:44:09,060 --> 0:44:11,210
We know your kind.

570
0:44:11,290 --> 0:44:12,550
You all say you didn't steal.

571
0:44:12,620 --> 0:44:14,050
I didn't, kind lord...

572
0:44:14,120 --> 0:44:17,890
Why did you flee, then?

573
0:44:17,960 --> 0:44:18,980
Is it better now?

574
0:44:19,060 --> 0:44:23,210
Don't turn me over to the boyar, master.

575
0:44:24,020 --> 0:44:27,190
He'll kill me. Take me as your slave.

576
0:44:27,330 --> 0:44:30,550
I'll do all you say, just don't take me back.

577
0:44:30,650 --> 0:44:32,140
- He won't kill you...  - Yes he will.

578
0:44:32,220 --> 0:44:35,050
Fish brains in a rabbit's head...

579
0:44:35,230 --> 0:44:39,390
He'll give you a beating and send you back to work.

580
0:44:39,560 --> 0:44:42,350
Where a boyar strikes, new skin grows.

581
0:44:42,420 --> 0:44:43,690
- Ain't that right, Tintiric?  - Right.

582
0:44:45,260 --> 0:44:46,960
On our street,

583
0:44:47,030 --> 0:44:50,660
a trader buried a man alive and the man died.

584
0:44:50,660 --> 0:44:53,820
- What trader?  - Kir Costea.

585
0:44:55,530 --> 0:44:58,990
He buried a man alive, many people saw.

586
0:44:59,070 --> 0:45:00,150
What had he done?

587
0:45:02,060 --> 0:45:05,030
No one told me.

588
0:45:05,300 --> 0:45:09,850
At least if I were guilty. But I ain't.

589
0:45:10,020 --> 0:45:12,920
Who else could be guilty? Me?

590
0:45:12,990 --> 0:45:15,330
His wife pushed me to fuck her.

591
0:45:15,700 --> 0:45:16,430
Hear that, Ionita,

592
0:45:16,500 --> 0:45:19,020
the crow claims he fucked the boyar's woman.

593
0:45:21,560 --> 0:45:24,120
Swear upon the devil's cod, upon Aaron's rod,

594
0:45:24,230 --> 0:45:25,460
so help you God!

595
0:45:25,530 --> 0:45:26,720
I swear.

596
0:45:26,800 --> 0:45:29,290
So how'd she push you, crow?

597
0:45:32,630 --> 0:45:37,160
She had her eyes set on me since they had bought me.

598
0:45:37,700 --> 0:45:39,430
But I couldn't believe...

599
0:45:40,490 --> 0:45:43,660
One day, I was watering the horses...

600
0:45:43,960 --> 0:45:48,460
She came quietly into the stables,

601
0:45:48,540 --> 0:45:49,890
hop! she climbed on top of me

602
0:45:49,960 --> 0:45:52,590
and rubbed her cunt against my nape.

603
0:45:53,330 --> 0:45:57,530
The old hen ain't scared of a thick cock!

604
0:45:57,600 --> 0:45:59,090
So you didn't like it?!

605
0:45:59,170 --> 0:46:04,360
I did, aren't I a man?

606
0:46:04,830 --> 0:46:06,700
The things I did to her...

607
0:46:07,300 --> 0:46:10,890
And if I hadn't liked it? She's my mistress.

608
0:46:11,260 --> 0:46:14,260
Then why'd you run from such grief, crow?

609
0:46:16,340 --> 0:46:19,890
The stable boy found out and told the boyar,

610
0:46:20,000 --> 0:46:23,730
who said he'd kill me... I ran for my life.

611
0:46:24,440 --> 0:46:27,460
- He's making it up!  - I'm not, good master...

612
0:46:27,570 --> 0:46:30,930
I've heard about the lady's fornication,

613
0:46:31,270 --> 0:46:34,430
even with her cousin.

614
0:46:34,540 --> 0:46:37,530
They even say she bore his child.

615
0:46:37,940 --> 0:46:41,700
I knew from the start this wasn't a clear business.

616
0:46:41,770 --> 0:46:42,820
What did I say?

617
0:46:43,370 --> 0:46:47,500
Two turtledoves in sweet love's fires, eh?

618
0:46:48,210 --> 0:46:50,190
Who had time for that...

619
0:47:01,900 --> 0:47:04,160
Curse them Turks.

620
0:47:17,910 --> 0:47:20,730
How to get to Licheresti? I know.

621
0:47:34,340 --> 0:47:35,810
Mind your words!

622
0:48:14,210 --> 0:48:16,510
He's my boy, he helps me.

623
0:48:20,340 --> 0:48:22,240
He wants to give you a gift.

624
0:48:27,950 --> 0:48:29,420
Say tesekkur.

625
0:48:31,980 --> 0:48:33,410
I want some.

626
0:48:38,720 --> 0:48:40,170
- What'd he want?  - To get to Licheresti.

627
0:48:40,280 --> 0:48:42,240
I sent the fool the other way.

628
0:48:42,450 --> 0:48:43,270
Aferim, father!

629
0:48:43,350 --> 0:48:48,050
I hate the Ottomans. The filthiest nation on Earth.

630
0:48:49,910 --> 0:48:52,210
And he talked to me like I was shit.

631
0:48:52,350 --> 0:48:53,470
Said he was afraid of the haidouks...

632
0:48:53,580 --> 0:48:57,070
I hope our Romanian boys catch him

633
0:48:57,150 --> 0:48:58,880
and tan his skin.

634
0:48:59,350 --> 0:49:00,810
They should.

635
0:49:01,510 --> 0:49:04,240
You can tell from their talk that they's nothin' but beasts.

636
0:49:04,320 --> 0:49:07,220
- Give me some.  - Fine, have some.

637
0:49:08,020 --> 0:49:10,530
We work like morons for them and the boyars...

638
0:49:15,950 --> 0:49:17,180
It's closer...

639
0:49:17,690 --> 0:49:20,610
We can do some good business,without wasting time.

640
0:49:26,490 --> 0:49:28,420
Look what I found for you, cricket.

641
0:49:28,960 --> 0:49:31,410
You can find ripe fruit under the driest leaf.

642
0:49:33,780 --> 0:49:35,410
Master, don't take me back!

643
0:49:35,490 --> 0:49:37,610
Bey-mu, what can I do?

644
0:49:37,720 --> 0:49:40,840
Clap my hands and make you a divan-effendi?!

645
0:49:41,120 --> 0:49:42,610
Take me to your home!

646
0:49:42,820 --> 0:49:45,840
I can work the fields, cook...

647
0:49:45,920 --> 0:49:47,580
I don't need that. I have a wife.

648
0:49:47,660 --> 0:49:49,020
Have pity, bright lord.

649
0:49:49,090 --> 0:49:50,710
Be thankful I don't beat you.

650
0:49:50,780 --> 0:49:52,650
I give you a finger, don't ask for the whole hand.

651
0:49:59,260 --> 0:50:00,740
You struck bad luck.

652
0:50:01,350 --> 0:50:04,480
But I had my good days too.

653
0:50:04,550 --> 0:50:05,490
When?

654
0:50:05,560 --> 0:50:08,020
When I was a slave for his highness Bibescu.

655
0:50:08,090 --> 0:50:10,240
Then, when he died,

656
0:50:10,350 --> 0:50:13,810
for his highness Manu and Lady Smaranda Vacarescu.

657
0:50:13,890 --> 0:50:16,880
- Lies, Gypsy.  - I swear!

658
0:50:16,960 --> 0:50:19,750
I was looking after the horses...

659
0:50:19,850 --> 0:50:22,340
I even went with him to Paris, to Leipzig.

660
0:50:22,420 --> 0:50:23,480
To Vienna, too...

661
0:50:23,620 --> 0:50:25,180
I've seen the world.

662
0:50:25,730 --> 0:50:27,520
Did you fuck Lady Smaranda, too?

663
0:50:27,590 --> 0:50:29,520
No way!

664
0:50:30,850 --> 0:50:32,880
She hardly even looked at us Gypsies,

665
0:50:32,990 --> 0:50:36,390
she only talked with her sly crones...

666
0:50:36,830 --> 0:50:40,720
So, how does lady Sultana go when she fucks?

667
0:50:40,820 --> 0:50:43,220
Does she moan and move?

668
0:50:45,060 --> 0:50:47,360
She moves her big buttocks hard.

669
0:50:47,890 --> 0:50:50,350
She doesn't moan, for fear someone might hear...

670
0:50:50,690 --> 0:50:52,550
And she whispered in my ear:

671
0:50:53,030 --> 0:50:58,120
"Psihi-mu, I like your cock so! Stick it deeper!"

672
0:51:00,350 --> 0:51:04,150
And after I let myself go,

673
0:51:05,160 --> 0:51:08,360
she'd whisper:

674
0:51:09,520 --> 0:51:12,920
"Mashallah, Gypsy!"

675
0:51:13,130 --> 0:51:13,990
I see...

676
0:51:15,660 --> 0:51:17,130
So how's the world?

677
0:51:20,520 --> 0:51:23,250
Big and beautiful... Not like here.

678
0:51:23,330 --> 0:51:25,620
He knows his stuff!

679
0:51:26,330 --> 0:51:27,690
So, what's it like in Vienna?

680
0:51:27,800 --> 0:51:31,550
I've never left our county except for father's work.

681
0:51:33,330 --> 0:51:36,160
I don't know what to say...

682
0:51:36,500 --> 0:51:39,820
Like three of our towns, only with palaces.

683
0:51:40,460 --> 0:51:41,390
How 'bout Leipzig?

684
0:51:41,630 --> 0:51:44,490
It's smaller. But prettier than anything here.

685
0:51:44,600 --> 0:51:45,490
And Paris?

686
0:51:45,830 --> 0:51:52,730
Big, like ten Viennas...

687
0:51:53,160 --> 0:51:57,000
Cobbled roads, countless princesses.

688
0:51:58,000 --> 0:51:59,460
And they don't beat their servants.

689
0:51:59,530 --> 0:52:00,650
Lies!

690
0:52:00,760 --> 0:52:02,560
It ain't lies!

691
0:52:14,130 --> 0:52:20,060
When lady Manu married that dumb Russian prince,

692
0:52:20,760 --> 0:52:26,360
she asked as dowry for a Vienna carriage.

693
0:52:27,740 --> 0:52:29,720
In exchange we, thirty souls of Gypsies,

694
0:52:29,800 --> 0:52:32,090
were given to boyar Filipescu.

695
0:52:33,130 --> 0:52:35,460
The beatings we got there with ox sinews...

696
0:52:37,100 --> 0:52:41,330
Three months ago, master Filipescu auctioned away

697
0:52:41,770 --> 0:52:44,330
some five hundred Gypsy souls.

698
0:52:46,640 --> 0:52:49,760
Master Candescu bought me from him.

699
0:52:50,230 --> 0:52:53,030
I asked him to buy my family too...

700
0:52:53,300 --> 0:52:56,270
We have no concern with your life...

701
0:52:56,370 --> 0:52:58,240
We're hardworking...

702
0:53:28,440 --> 0:53:31,130
Make Way!

703
0:53:35,440 --> 0:53:36,670
What's this?

704
0:53:37,540 --> 0:53:38,980
Vasilache and Marioara.

705
0:53:43,810 --> 0:53:50,200
I'm a man, not a mouse.

706
0:53:50,300 --> 0:53:55,540
Take this, if you're a man!

707
0:53:59,740 --> 0:54:01,670
'Tis like they's real men.

708
0:54:02,410 --> 0:54:04,130
No, you dimwit, they's dolls

709
0:54:04,210 --> 0:54:05,540
with people moving them!

710
0:54:16,610 --> 0:54:18,310
Crack the stupid bitch's head!

711
0:54:19,120 --> 0:54:20,570
Will you be quiet now?

712
0:54:21,310 --> 0:54:25,740
Now she's upset. Get up, Marioara!

713
0:54:25,810 --> 0:54:26,800
Fuck her!

714
0:54:27,180 --> 0:54:28,770
Shut up! She's dead

715
0:54:31,640 --> 0:54:33,770
The priest!

716
0:54:35,210 --> 0:54:37,410
...let's give her a funeral!

717
0:54:37,820 --> 0:54:39,800
What funeral? You're drunk!

718
0:54:39,870 --> 0:54:42,900
Go to hell with your Marioara!

719
0:54:48,180 --> 0:54:50,400
Look at him beating that priest!

720
0:54:58,180 --> 0:55:01,630
Whosoever buys us,

721
0:55:01,950 --> 0:55:04,780
we will be slaves to his house,

722
0:55:04,950 --> 0:55:08,470
we and our offspring,

723
0:55:09,410 --> 0:55:10,970
just save us from hunger...

724
0:55:11,080 --> 0:55:13,200
Back off, everyone!

725
0:55:21,450 --> 0:55:23,440
Take pity on me, master!

726
0:55:23,580 --> 0:55:25,450
Didn't you say you don't want to go back to the merchant?

727
0:55:25,550 --> 0:55:27,410
Who will buy me?

728
0:55:27,490 --> 0:55:30,450
might end up with one who will beat me to death.

729
0:55:30,550 --> 0:55:32,880
We'll find you a good man.

730
0:55:32,950 --> 0:55:34,580
We won't give you to just anyone.

731
0:55:34,650 --> 0:55:35,580
Good, then...

732
0:55:41,480 --> 0:55:44,540
Buy me, honourable lords!

733
0:55:45,290 --> 0:55:48,340
I'm a hardworking, obedient slave!

734
0:56:04,520 --> 0:56:07,210
Take us, master! We are freed slaves.

735
0:56:07,290 --> 0:56:08,410
- How many of you?  - A clan.

736
0:56:08,520 --> 0:56:10,180
Back off!

737
0:56:12,050 --> 0:56:13,210
How much?

738
0:56:13,290 --> 0:56:14,980
Almost nothing. Ten piastres.

739
0:56:15,050 --> 0:56:18,510
Expensive! For that I can buy two big ones.

740
0:56:18,590 --> 0:56:21,680
This is the price of the market. I know the worth of a slave...

741
0:56:21,880 --> 0:56:23,680
Let me see your beak, crow.

742
0:56:26,960 --> 0:56:28,650
Doesn't even have all his teeth.

743
0:56:28,730 --> 0:56:32,120
Bey-mu, they'll grow. He's a child.

744
0:56:33,590 --> 0:56:34,680
Thin as a rake, too.

745
0:56:34,760 --> 0:56:37,160
No, he has iron bones.

746
0:56:37,220 --> 0:56:38,620
He's sturdy stock.

747
0:56:41,750 --> 0:56:42,950
Come to the scalesmaster.

748
0:56:43,020 --> 0:56:43,780
What for?

749
0:56:43,860 --> 0:56:45,150
To see how much he weighs.

750
0:56:46,730 --> 0:56:47,820
- Where is he?  - There.

751
0:56:47,890 --> 0:56:48,980
Where are you taking me, master?

752
0:56:54,320 --> 0:56:57,220
Buy us, bright lords!

753
0:56:57,590 --> 0:56:58,720
Three stone and a half.

754
0:56:58,830 --> 0:57:00,650
See, he's in excellent condition.

755
0:57:06,490 --> 0:57:09,750
I want to give him to our holy church.

756
0:57:09,950 --> 0:57:11,150
Drop it three piastres.

757
0:57:11,220 --> 0:57:13,020
No more than one.

758
0:57:13,360 --> 0:57:14,920
Do you have papers? Or is he stolen?

759
0:57:14,990 --> 0:57:18,950
No one will find him. I'm a lawkeeper.

760
0:57:19,150 --> 0:57:21,250
Without papers, four piastres.

761
0:57:21,320 --> 0:57:23,690
What is he, a chicken? He's a slave!

762
0:57:23,830 --> 0:57:25,620
Let's see who will give you more.

763
0:57:26,390 --> 0:57:28,160
At least five.

764
0:57:29,620 --> 0:57:30,420
Deal.

765
0:57:30,490 --> 0:57:32,290
Don't give me away, master!

766
0:57:38,430 --> 0:57:39,790
They're not forged, are they?

767
0:57:42,530 --> 0:57:43,820
How much for the one on the horse?

768
0:57:43,930 --> 0:57:44,620
Two piastres.

769
0:57:44,700 --> 0:57:47,390
He's not for sale.

770
0:57:48,200 --> 0:57:50,710
A pity, he was a good one. Come on, crow!

771
0:57:52,760 --> 0:57:54,160
Good luck, Tintiric!

772
0:57:54,460 --> 0:57:56,290
What are you meddling for?

773
0:58:01,860 --> 0:58:05,160
Father! Come on up!

774
0:58:05,260 --> 0:58:07,250
No, it's not for me.

775
0:58:08,600 --> 0:58:09,990
Come on!

776
0:58:10,090 --> 0:58:12,080
- Is that good?  - Yes!

777
0:58:27,340 --> 0:58:29,090
Amazing!

778
0:58:37,640 --> 0:58:39,420
Money wasted...

779
0:58:59,130 --> 0:59:01,990
What can I do, Carfin? You made your own bed.

780
0:59:02,060 --> 0:59:03,160
Have pity, constable,

781
0:59:03,230 --> 0:59:05,390
set me free! Ionita!

782
0:59:05,470 --> 0:59:08,270
I can't deceive the boyar...

783
0:59:09,900 --> 0:59:13,030
But I'll tell him how that bitch jumped you...

784
0:59:13,470 --> 0:59:18,340
He will lock her up in some convent.

785
0:59:18,400 --> 0:59:23,630
So what? He'll still kill me.

786
0:59:23,700 --> 0:59:25,900
Enough whining, he won't kill you.

787
0:59:27,610 --> 0:59:29,030
I'll ask him to just beat you a little.

788
0:59:33,740 --> 0:59:35,170
He'll kill me, master!

789
1:00:06,310 --> 1:00:08,430
Will you buy me some sweets?

790
1:00:08,510 --> 1:00:09,990
No money for that.

791
1:00:10,740 --> 1:00:11,860
Come on, crow!

792
1:00:17,180 --> 1:00:18,640
How much to sleep here?

793
1:00:18,830 --> 1:00:21,830
Twenty for a man, five for a horse.

794
1:00:22,470 --> 1:00:26,640
Bring us ham and some cheap wine.

795
1:00:27,110 --> 1:00:30,500
A starving dog dreams of nothing but bones.

796
1:00:31,270 --> 1:00:34,260
- Lica ate, drank, and didn't pay.  - Nevermind.

797
1:00:36,540 --> 1:00:37,670
What did that crow do?

798
1:00:37,980 --> 1:00:40,130
Ran away from a boyar.

799
1:00:40,640 --> 1:00:41,970
If he was my crow,

800
1:00:42,340 --> 1:00:46,300
I'd have blinded him and cut off his legs.

801
1:00:50,840 --> 1:00:51,900
Go to hell!

802
1:00:53,610 --> 1:00:55,270
Dig in.

803
1:00:56,110 --> 1:00:59,970
The rich look in the mirror,the poor  - in their plate.

804
1:01:01,240 --> 1:01:03,300
Damn good.

805
1:01:05,850 --> 1:01:07,280
You're badly ill, father.

806
1:01:07,350 --> 1:01:10,030
I have this nixis in my chest.

807
1:01:10,670 --> 1:01:15,200
My teeth rattle,the shovel is waiting...

808
1:01:15,410 --> 1:01:17,540
How about the doctors in Bucharest?

809
1:01:17,620 --> 1:01:20,100
It's your turn to live, Ionita...

810
1:01:20,580 --> 1:01:24,630
Feels like yesterday I was servingunder bailiff Vladimirescu.

811
1:01:24,750 --> 1:01:26,740
What a life, fuck...

812
1:01:29,780 --> 1:01:31,440
Sigh louder, crow!

813
1:01:34,450 --> 1:01:38,280
I was storming women away during the uprising.

814
1:01:38,590 --> 1:01:40,560
We would enter a village,

815
1:01:40,910 --> 1:01:43,610
kill their cattle and party wildly...

816
1:01:44,950 --> 1:01:45,940
When was that?

817
1:01:46,050 --> 1:01:48,240
Around 1821. You were a babe.

818
1:01:48,450 --> 1:01:50,170
You know what our song was?

819
1:01:50,250 --> 1:01:50,900
no

820
1:01:50,980 --> 1:01:52,840
Seven vales and seven hills.

821
1:01:52,910 --> 1:01:54,680
Fuck the boyars to the gills

822
1:01:54,750 --> 1:01:58,240
Soon I'll catch you by the mane,Mash you bloody with my cane...

823
1:02:22,050 --> 1:02:27,350
We were feared, we killed them like pigs.

824
1:02:27,520 --> 1:02:30,170
We were as wild as leopards.

825
1:02:32,450 --> 1:02:34,680
I was a mercenary...

826
1:02:35,120 --> 1:02:40,480
I had a cunt in every village. Don't tell your mother!

827
1:02:40,550 --> 1:02:41,450
Sure.

828
1:02:41,520 --> 1:02:42,850
You're a big boy now.

829
1:02:43,380 --> 1:02:45,150
You know how crazy she gets.

830
1:02:50,420 --> 1:02:52,380
My life's all done...

831
1:02:53,350 --> 1:02:58,050
All our lives flow like a stream,

832
1:02:58,160 --> 1:03:01,810
It all passes like a dream.

833
1:03:02,650 --> 1:03:03,550
Eat some!

834
1:03:06,890 --> 1:03:10,440
The good stuff passed like the wind.

835
1:03:13,660 --> 1:03:15,320
Want a drop of wine?

836
1:03:15,560 --> 1:03:16,620
Sure!

837
1:03:27,390 --> 1:03:32,790
While drunk, don't give gifts, nor do harm.

838
1:03:33,890 --> 1:03:39,840
If you do want to give, then give while sober.

839
1:03:56,860 --> 1:03:58,290
Hey, innkeeper!

840
1:03:59,320 --> 1:04:01,220
Bring us a whore.

841
1:04:01,360 --> 1:04:02,410
Right away.

842
1:04:03,090 --> 1:04:05,720
Zambila, get over here!

843
1:04:06,030 --> 1:04:08,950
I don't want no Gypsy. I want a clean woman!

844
1:04:09,790 --> 1:04:11,120
Clean she is, man.

845
1:04:11,960 --> 1:04:15,550
Take my son and do what you know best.

846
1:04:15,630 --> 1:04:16,600
I will.

847
1:04:18,330 --> 1:04:20,920
Innkeeper! I want this pretty one!

848
1:04:20,990 --> 1:04:24,450
Oi, that's my wife. Let go!

849
1:04:24,800 --> 1:04:26,850
You got the French disease?

850
1:04:26,930 --> 1:04:28,020
Of course not.

851
1:04:28,100 --> 1:04:29,060
What's your name?

852
1:04:29,460 --> 1:04:30,120
Zambila.

853
1:04:30,230 --> 1:04:31,750
How much for you?

854
1:04:31,830 --> 1:04:33,090
Fifteen.

855
1:04:33,260 --> 1:04:34,250
That's a lot.

856
1:04:37,770 --> 1:04:38,620
Come with me!

857
1:04:39,490 --> 1:04:41,720
Don't embarrass me, lad.

858
1:05:00,630 --> 1:05:03,500
He's not a bad boy, but he's girlish,

859
1:05:03,570 --> 1:05:05,690
his mother's too soft with him.

860
1:05:06,470 --> 1:05:08,370
He's not very respectful...

861
1:05:08,730 --> 1:05:10,020
He's a good lad.

862
1:05:10,430 --> 1:05:13,020
That's how I'd like my children to be.

863
1:05:13,100 --> 1:05:14,720
You got children, Carfin?

864
1:05:14,800 --> 1:05:15,560
No.

865
1:05:15,640 --> 1:05:17,860
Maybe next year, if my wife doesn't die.

866
1:05:17,940 --> 1:05:23,230
You came here from England to teach us your fuckin' ethics?

867
1:05:24,170 --> 1:05:27,400
What's that idiot say?

868
1:05:30,930 --> 1:05:32,660
You, go away!

869
1:05:37,670 --> 1:05:39,060
Dumb outlanders!

870
1:05:39,700 --> 1:05:42,820
How's 'bout playing an otuzbir with us?

871
1:05:42,900 --> 1:05:43,520
No.

872
1:05:46,610 --> 1:05:48,820
Then spit on us and let us be.

873
1:05:49,200 --> 1:05:50,690
Spit on you?!

874
1:05:50,870 --> 1:05:52,890
I could trim you with this sword.

875
1:05:53,000 --> 1:05:56,800
It's a saying from Targoviste, you know?

876
1:05:56,870 --> 1:06:00,460
Small town, great poverty!

877
1:06:00,830 --> 1:06:02,630
True, constable.

878
1:06:03,000 --> 1:06:06,440
They say two youngsters went to get married.

879
1:06:06,810 --> 1:06:10,130
But the priest read them the last rites instead.

880
1:06:11,300 --> 1:06:13,100
Then the baptism rites.

881
1:06:13,170 --> 1:06:16,440
When he was supposed to blow over them,

882
1:06:16,670 --> 1:06:19,760
the youngsters, disgusted with his stupidity, said:

883
1:06:21,740 --> 1:06:25,360
"After such a mess,"

884
1:06:25,570 --> 1:06:31,000
"better spit on us and let us be."

885
1:06:32,640 --> 1:06:36,400
Stupid priest! Spit on us and let us be.

886
1:06:58,500 --> 1:07:00,630
Aferim, Ionita!

887
1:07:00,700 --> 1:07:02,140
For a sweet thing like a kiss,

888
1:07:02,210 --> 1:07:04,230
There's no penance from the priest.

889
1:07:04,370 --> 1:07:05,810
Right, Father?

890
1:07:05,880 --> 1:07:06,900
Yes, son.

891
1:07:06,980 --> 1:07:10,400
- Keep your eye on him.  - Sure.

892
1:07:10,470 --> 1:07:11,660
How did it go?

893
1:07:11,770 --> 1:07:14,240
He's strong like a bull.

894
1:07:14,310 --> 1:07:15,140
Well done!

895
1:07:19,170 --> 1:07:21,140
You're not all that strong-built.

896
1:07:21,440 --> 1:07:23,410
Were you hatched from an egg?

897
1:07:23,480 --> 1:07:25,410
What can I do?

898
1:07:25,980 --> 1:07:27,000
Hey, you'll set me on fire.

899
1:07:32,810 --> 1:07:36,610
Tight of cunt and hard of butt, Makes the cock crack like a nut...

900
1:07:37,280 --> 1:07:41,940
We'll repent when we're old.

901
1:07:42,180 --> 1:07:43,140
Father...

902
1:07:44,510 --> 1:07:46,440
- I'm coming with you.  - Better not.

903
1:07:46,510 --> 1:07:48,600
There's room for more!

904
1:08:24,820 --> 1:08:27,720
Don't know what's wrong with me.

905
1:08:29,310 --> 1:08:34,680
I got a burn in my cock...

906
1:08:36,220 --> 1:08:40,170
I feel sorry for you, but give me the money.

907
1:08:40,550 --> 1:08:41,600
I didn't?

908
1:08:41,710 --> 1:08:43,380
Only for the boy.

909
1:08:43,950 --> 1:08:48,080
Don't scream like a frog in the snake's mouth,I'll pay.

910
1:09:02,450 --> 1:09:05,210
Bite it, crow!

911
1:09:11,620 --> 1:09:13,080
Don't make a fool out of me!

912
1:09:13,180 --> 1:09:14,980
What's this?

913
1:09:15,050 --> 1:09:17,540
He has to take the dime from the fire.

914
1:09:30,050 --> 1:09:31,350
Not with your hand.

915
1:09:33,250 --> 1:09:35,120
Take it now!

916
1:09:43,920 --> 1:09:45,980
Oh, shut up.

917
1:10:08,650 --> 1:10:10,950
Alas, poor me!

918
1:10:19,220 --> 1:10:20,810
Who has a stick?

919
1:10:21,960 --> 1:10:22,920
What for?

920
1:10:23,660 --> 1:10:25,450
These damn rats.

921
1:10:27,530 --> 1:10:29,150
They's everywhere.

922
1:10:33,430 --> 1:10:35,480
And enough lice to shovel them.

923
1:10:37,330 --> 1:10:39,620
A cricket's chirping under my head.

924
1:10:41,320 --> 1:10:42,720
Chirp back, then.

925
1:10:44,530 --> 1:10:46,590
Turn with your head this way.

926
1:11:16,270 --> 1:11:17,250
Father.

927
1:11:18,320 --> 1:11:19,350
What?

928
1:11:19,960 --> 1:11:22,020
Can't we just let him go?

929
1:11:24,300 --> 1:11:25,130
Who?

930
1:11:25,930 --> 1:11:28,220
Carfin. He ain't guilty.

931
1:11:30,690 --> 1:11:31,750
The country's torn apart with prongs

932
1:11:31,860 --> 1:11:33,730
And the cunt sings merry songs...

933
1:11:34,400 --> 1:11:37,830
What are you, a dean?

934
1:11:38,290 --> 1:11:44,530
Just thinkin', why should he be punished if he ain't guilty...

935
1:11:44,930 --> 1:11:47,530
Enough with this old maid's dream.

936
1:11:47,940 --> 1:11:52,830
Our job is to catch runaways,

937
1:11:53,260 --> 1:11:54,530
and we caught him.

938
1:11:55,400 --> 1:11:57,870
From here on, there's laws, rules,

939
1:11:58,290 --> 1:11:59,520
'tis not for us to pry.

940
1:11:59,700 --> 1:12:01,590
But you're a constable...

941
1:12:02,200 --> 1:12:06,460
So what? The law's for everyone.

942
1:12:06,540 --> 1:12:10,150
We must all follow it.

943
1:12:12,170 --> 1:12:17,130
I've been honest all my life. Done my job lawfully.

944
1:12:26,340 --> 1:12:29,020
This world's full of evildoers, Ionita.

945
1:12:30,370 --> 1:12:34,730
I've seen some freeing locked up thieves at night

946
1:12:34,840 --> 1:12:41,760
so they could steal horses and cows, then locking them back in...

947
1:12:43,800 --> 1:12:49,030
And they shared the loot. I don't do such deeds.

948
1:12:49,700 --> 1:12:50,790
I know.

949
1:12:53,240 --> 1:12:56,600
And I haven't been mean to folks like other constables.

950
1:12:58,010 --> 1:13:01,020
I never beat a soul for nothing.

951
1:13:02,300 --> 1:13:02,930
I know.

952
1:13:03,000 --> 1:13:04,940
I've always been fair.

953
1:13:05,810 --> 1:13:07,600
If we weren't fair either,

954
1:13:08,370 --> 1:13:10,960
our country would go straight to Hell.

955
1:13:12,340 --> 1:13:17,000
But I ain't never been black-hearted.

956
1:13:17,780 --> 1:13:21,070
I know. What if we said we couldn't find him?

957
1:13:23,540 --> 1:13:27,600
Want us to be everyone's laughingstock

958
1:13:28,140 --> 1:13:29,760
and not get a single dime?

959
1:13:30,870 --> 1:13:34,170
You can't feed the wolf and save your lambs.

960
1:13:35,540 --> 1:13:39,590
Cursed whore's sons, shut those mouths!

961
1:13:40,310 --> 1:13:41,740
Come on, let's sleep.

962
1:13:42,370 --> 1:13:44,240
Sleep keeps hunger away.

963
1:14:01,140 --> 1:14:03,610
My head hurts bad.

964
1:14:03,910 --> 1:14:06,140
Let me ward off the evil eye from him.

965
1:14:07,010 --> 1:14:08,730
Go ahead, Carfin.

966
1:14:08,810 --> 1:14:12,210
He didn't drink much. I drank like a sow,

967
1:14:12,340 --> 1:14:13,540
I'm still hazy...

968
1:14:13,610 --> 1:14:14,770
Come over here, Ionita!

969
1:14:15,350 --> 1:14:16,710
I won't eat you!

970
1:14:19,540 --> 1:14:22,200
All ache and ail, leave the inside of the head,

971
1:14:22,750 --> 1:14:25,010
the hearing of the ears...

972
1:14:44,410 --> 1:14:45,780
Shake yourself, Ionita!

973
1:14:47,480 --> 1:14:49,670
It'll pass, little master, you'll see.

974
1:14:49,780 --> 1:14:55,180
O treacherous world, first sweet, then bitter...

975
1:15:22,410 --> 1:15:25,400
When the rogues don't set the woods on fire,

976
1:15:25,640 --> 1:15:27,370
we cut them all to the ground.

977
1:15:28,200 --> 1:15:30,830
Wallachia's forests are cracking under the axe...

978
1:15:31,710 --> 1:15:34,180
Good country, bad ruling!

979
1:15:38,310 --> 1:15:42,540
I wonder, Ionita,a few hundred years from now,

980
1:15:42,610 --> 1:15:45,840
d'you think folks will say a good word about us?

981
1:15:49,240 --> 1:15:50,670
I don't know, father.

982
1:15:54,650 --> 1:15:56,670
I think they won't say a thing.

983
1:15:57,940 --> 1:16:01,340
They won't think that we smoothed their path in life.

984
1:16:02,880 --> 1:16:06,310
Or they'll only curse our souls to hell.

985
1:16:07,680 --> 1:16:11,130
Gone the day, gone the night...

986
1:16:25,950 --> 1:16:28,500
Ease up, constable.

987
1:16:38,080 --> 1:16:41,100
In two long hours we're home.

988
1:16:41,550 --> 1:16:43,270
We'll get there by dusk.

989
1:16:56,250 --> 1:16:59,270
Alas, unjust death and cheating world!

990
1:17:00,410 --> 1:17:04,010
You bring people comfort, then bury them.

991
1:17:38,110 --> 1:17:41,310
...Alexander the Great studied with

992
1:17:41,750 --> 1:17:43,080
a great philosopher, Aristoteles.

993
1:17:43,450 --> 1:17:47,050
He taught him all the Psalms.

994
1:17:47,130 --> 1:17:51,410
All the worthy men wondered at how fast he learned.

995
1:17:55,460 --> 1:17:58,240
What, Carfin, do you feel the noose tightening?

996
1:17:59,420 --> 1:18:01,050
He'll kill me, master.

997
1:18:01,350 --> 1:18:03,080
I beg of you like I beg the Holy Virgin,

998
1:18:03,160 --> 1:18:04,820
put a word in for me with the boyar!

999
1:18:05,590 --> 1:18:10,980
I swear I'll show him you couldn't help it.

1000
1:18:11,420 --> 1:18:14,290
I've been a constable for many years, I have his ear.

1001
1:18:14,560 --> 1:18:16,220
May the Lord give you health!

1002
1:18:16,290 --> 1:18:17,350
Same to all of us.

1003
1:18:18,550 --> 1:18:20,780
If he wants to harm you, I won't let him.

1004
1:18:20,920 --> 1:18:23,390
Some whipping, that's all.

1005
1:18:23,660 --> 1:18:24,620
That's bad too.

1006
1:18:24,730 --> 1:18:27,880
Tis no pleasure, but it passes

1007
1:18:27,990 --> 1:18:30,280
All goes away,Like the rain in May.

1008
1:18:32,560 --> 1:18:33,350
What?

1009
1:18:33,460 --> 1:18:36,220
Or he'll choke me to death

1010
1:18:36,300 --> 1:18:38,250
with hot pepper smoke, fuck his black soul...

1011
1:18:39,060 --> 1:18:44,360
If you put in a word, I won't ever do another bad deed.

1012
1:18:44,930 --> 1:18:47,520
And if you need something, I'll help you.

1013
1:18:48,190 --> 1:18:50,160
Our Carfin eats humble pie...

1014
1:18:53,290 --> 1:18:56,920
But in the ass of the humble the Devil sits cross-legged...

1015
1:18:57,570 --> 1:18:59,420
My shot wounds are hurting...

1016
1:18:59,520 --> 1:19:03,550
Stop pouting like a duck, they ain't but cat scratches...

1017
1:19:04,300 --> 1:19:07,600
'Twas your own doing for hiding from us...

1018
1:19:12,290 --> 1:19:14,690
You have a good life nowadays.

1019
1:19:16,100 --> 1:19:17,000
Who?

1020
1:19:17,130 --> 1:19:18,380
You Gypsies.

1021
1:19:19,030 --> 1:19:23,290
In the olden days, the Voivod woke up and said:

1022
1:19:23,500 --> 1:19:27,160
"Today I feel like hunting crows!"

1023
1:19:27,370 --> 1:19:31,350
And they got some slaves up a tree

1024
1:19:31,560 --> 1:19:32,550
and the Voivod shot arrows at them

1025
1:19:32,660 --> 1:19:35,060
'til he killed one.

1026
1:19:36,230 --> 1:19:37,820
'Til he hunted down a crow...

1027
1:19:38,830 --> 1:19:41,290
Could be. Woe is us...

1028
1:20:02,500 --> 1:20:03,830
Easy, little master.

1029
1:20:06,540 --> 1:20:09,790
So they see you've come on foot...

1030
1:20:10,030 --> 1:20:11,830
It hurts, I can't walk.

1031
1:20:13,970 --> 1:20:17,860
Better lame and on foot than blind and in the saddle.

1032
1:20:27,040 --> 1:20:29,090
Easy, master, it hurts.

1033
1:21:05,770 --> 1:21:08,790
Constable, I have a word with you.

1034
1:21:09,340 --> 1:21:10,130
Speak!

1035
1:21:10,900 --> 1:21:12,800
My horse was stolen.

1036
1:21:12,910 --> 1:21:13,600
Where'd you keep it?

1037
1:21:13,670 --> 1:21:14,730
Behind the house...

1038
1:21:15,010 --> 1:21:16,470
And what am I to do?

1039
1:21:16,840 --> 1:21:21,360
Help me get the thief. I'll thank you with something.

1040
1:21:21,470 --> 1:21:24,410
First see if it didn't stray.

1041
1:21:24,470 --> 1:21:26,700
Look for it everywhere.

1042
1:21:26,910 --> 1:21:28,270
As the saying goes:

1043
1:21:28,340 --> 1:21:29,630
I was looking for my mare

1044
1:21:30,200 --> 1:21:32,730
and I found I was astride it...

1045
1:21:51,910 --> 1:21:53,200
Crow, is the boyar home?

1046
1:21:53,280 --> 1:21:54,830
He ain't, master.

1047
1:21:55,210 --> 1:21:56,070
Where's Vasile?

1048
1:21:56,150 --> 1:21:57,530
I'll go get him.

1049
1:22:08,240 --> 1:22:09,700
Where'd you find the crow?

1050
1:22:09,770 --> 1:22:10,830
None of your business.

1051
1:22:11,080 --> 1:22:12,470
Have you paid your impost?

1052
1:22:13,010 --> 1:22:14,480
I'll come and check.

1053
1:22:14,550 --> 1:22:17,630
We don't have nothin'!

1054
1:22:17,710 --> 1:22:19,400
What will we send to Istanbul

1055
1:22:19,510 --> 1:22:20,970
and all the others we owe?!

1056
1:22:21,780 --> 1:22:24,040
Want the Ivans or the Turks

1057
1:22:24,110 --> 1:22:25,480
to come kill us?

1058
1:22:25,580 --> 1:22:27,140
But the boyar pardoned us last year...

1059
1:22:27,220 --> 1:22:31,140
That was last year... Easter don't come every day.

1060
1:22:32,510 --> 1:22:34,670
Rabble...

1061
1:22:36,120 --> 1:22:38,000
Fuck your whore mother, Carfin!

1062
1:22:39,710 --> 1:22:41,470
Get away,or I'll bash your head in.

1063
1:22:41,710 --> 1:22:43,180
Stupid lowlife!

1064
1:22:45,650 --> 1:22:49,040
'Twas because of him the boyar gave us such torment here!

1065
1:22:50,180 --> 1:22:53,940
He'll cane him 'til the flesh comes off his back.

1066
1:22:54,020 --> 1:22:56,450
Mind the servants, they're like the pest.

1067
1:22:56,520 --> 1:22:58,440
Scat now, or I'll whip-fuck you!

1068
1:23:00,310 --> 1:23:01,540
Stupid people...

1069
1:23:03,250 --> 1:23:06,180
We'll go have a word with Lady Sultana.

1070
1:23:06,590 --> 1:23:07,540
She's in the tower.

1071
1:23:08,480 --> 1:23:10,600
- Guard Carfin!  - Sure I will.

1072
1:23:10,710 --> 1:23:13,410
Tell her I'm here!

1073
1:23:13,480 --> 1:23:16,610
They got you, Carfin!

1074
1:23:18,810 --> 1:23:22,080
- Take the night pot, it's full.  - Faster, crow.

1075
1:23:24,620 --> 1:23:26,640
Why didn't you throw it through the cracks?

1076
1:23:33,780 --> 1:23:37,150
Bless you, merciful lady.

1077
1:23:37,650 --> 1:23:43,020
May God give you happiness for your infinite good deeds.

1078
1:23:43,620 --> 1:23:46,550
I kiss your hand like a son.

1079
1:23:46,620 --> 1:23:48,980
This is Ionita, my boy and my helper.

1080
1:23:49,320 --> 1:23:51,310
Thank you for letting us in.

1081
1:23:51,490 --> 1:23:54,040
I didn't, you barged in. What do you want?

1082
1:23:54,150 --> 1:23:58,710
To tell you how my heart burns when I see you suffering.

1083
1:23:59,120 --> 1:24:02,210
We've come to hand Carfin over to the boyar...

1084
1:24:02,290 --> 1:24:03,150
How did you find him?

1085
1:24:03,250 --> 1:24:04,880
Me?

1086
1:24:04,960 --> 1:24:06,620
An old man knows what's in his bag...

1087
1:24:06,830 --> 1:24:07,610
What bag?

1088
1:24:07,680 --> 1:24:09,770
Don't you know the tale?

1089
1:24:09,850 --> 1:24:12,150
An old man was beating his wife with a bag

1090
1:24:12,250 --> 1:24:13,550
and people wondered,

1091
1:24:13,620 --> 1:24:15,890
not knowing the bag was filled with rocks.

1092
1:24:18,550 --> 1:24:19,540
Where was he?

1093
1:24:19,650 --> 1:24:21,380
Working for a craftsman.

1094
1:24:22,120 --> 1:24:26,350
Listen, he says the fault was yours

1095
1:24:26,430 --> 1:24:28,610
and the boyar shouldn't torment him...

1096
1:24:28,720 --> 1:24:32,280
I just want to complain to our Father Metropolitan,

1097
1:24:32,390 --> 1:24:35,080
but my husband keeps me locked up.

1098
1:24:35,160 --> 1:24:37,740
What for, kind lady?

1099
1:24:38,220 --> 1:24:41,680
The beastly beatings I've suffered

1100
1:24:42,090 --> 1:24:45,250
from this enemy of mine.

1101
1:24:45,830 --> 1:24:47,880
Heart of mine, don't cry so.

1102
1:24:47,950 --> 1:24:50,250
She cries all the time.

1103
1:24:50,390 --> 1:24:51,250
I see.

1104
1:24:53,060 --> 1:24:55,050
I thought he'd kill me.

1105
1:24:55,590 --> 1:24:59,520
I'll make a complaint, curse his soul.

1106
1:24:59,590 --> 1:25:02,580
What can we do, sweet lady? That's the way of the world,

1107
1:25:02,730 --> 1:25:07,590
the man has the right to punish his wife.

1108
1:25:07,950 --> 1:25:09,180
That's our law.

1109
1:25:09,690 --> 1:25:12,060
Yes, since Noah's days.

1110
1:25:12,690 --> 1:25:18,380
Adam himself kicked Eve in the stomach...

1111
1:25:18,460 --> 1:25:19,720
Oh, keep your mouth shut!

1112
1:25:20,730 --> 1:25:24,350
In the new law, and even in Ipsilanti's codes,

1113
1:25:24,430 --> 1:25:27,550
man is asked to beat his wife, but with kindness.

1114
1:25:27,660 --> 1:25:30,680
What kindness? He broke my back.

1115
1:25:31,530 --> 1:25:35,520
And I'm no lowborn or slave...

1116
1:25:35,600 --> 1:25:38,520
As Basarab's book of law says:

1117
1:25:39,090 --> 1:25:41,820
"Women shall be less castigated than men,

1118
1:25:41,890 --> 1:25:44,160
as they are dimmer of wit

1119
1:25:44,230 --> 1:25:47,200
and weaker before sin"...

1120
1:25:47,270 --> 1:25:50,160
I'm a dean's daughter, not a...

1121
1:25:50,230 --> 1:25:52,060
Did he beat you with a cane, or a sword...?

1122
1:25:52,160 --> 1:25:54,150
With his fists.

1123
1:25:54,230 --> 1:25:56,790
Then there's nothing to do.

1124
1:25:58,030 --> 1:26:01,090
Had he used a cane, I'd have taken your complaint myself.

1125
1:26:01,200 --> 1:26:02,490
But you have no grounds.

1126
1:26:02,730 --> 1:26:05,700
I'm here for the night pot.

1127
1:26:08,960 --> 1:26:13,020
Even the Metropolitan would say he was right.

1128
1:26:13,130 --> 1:26:15,830
Being guilty of adultery...

1129
1:26:16,140 --> 1:26:17,820
I'm not guilty of anything.

1130
1:26:19,200 --> 1:26:21,160
Tell me what happened.

1131
1:26:21,300 --> 1:26:25,130
Carfin says it was you who lured him...

1132
1:26:25,200 --> 1:26:26,790
I will not speak of that.

1133
1:26:27,290 --> 1:26:29,450
Merciful lady, he has a soul, too.

1134
1:26:30,360 --> 1:26:32,890
If the boyar beats him,

1135
1:26:33,700 --> 1:26:37,230
or kills him for nothing...

1136
1:26:38,760 --> 1:26:41,290
'Tis a great sin on your head...

1137
1:26:41,970 --> 1:26:43,130
Fine.

1138
1:26:43,840 --> 1:26:45,500
Tell the boyar it's my fault as well,

1139
1:26:45,600 --> 1:26:46,900
so he'll leave him be.

1140
1:26:46,970 --> 1:26:48,390
Many thanks.

1141
1:26:48,700 --> 1:26:52,460
We'll just interrogate him and give him his fair share.

1142
1:26:52,530 --> 1:26:54,430
By our Christian law.

1143
1:26:57,530 --> 1:27:01,160
Don't be distressed, I'll tell the boyar

1144
1:27:01,270 --> 1:27:03,730
to be more gentle with you.

1145
1:27:04,240 --> 1:27:06,860
Thank you, Carfin. But he's a bad man.

1146
1:27:07,170 --> 1:27:09,220
He said he'd lock me up in the monastery.

1147
1:27:09,670 --> 1:27:13,190
He only seems mean, but he's got a heart of gold.

1148
1:27:13,440 --> 1:27:19,890
We'll talk to him. We'll leave you with God.

1149
1:27:20,970 --> 1:27:22,200
Stay with God, lady!

1150
1:27:34,910 --> 1:27:36,600
Close that!

1151
1:27:53,470 --> 1:27:55,670
Long live our bright lord!

1152
1:28:01,570 --> 1:28:03,840
I have seven children, bright lord.

1153
1:28:12,210 --> 1:28:12,670
Look at him.

1154
1:28:14,880 --> 1:28:16,210
Aferim, Costandin!

1155
1:28:16,280 --> 1:28:17,570
Please, a word with you.

1156
1:28:20,240 --> 1:28:21,500
Take the hawk.

1157
1:28:24,210 --> 1:28:25,700
I was sure you wouldn't find him.

1158
1:28:25,950 --> 1:28:27,660
I wanted to send a posse.

1159
1:28:27,740 --> 1:28:30,300
We swore we'd find him!

1160
1:28:30,440 --> 1:28:34,400
To serve your lordship, we'd go through fire.

1161
1:28:35,550 --> 1:28:37,070
Aferim, Costandin,

1162
1:28:37,370 --> 1:28:39,310
may you live as long as the Coltea Tower.

1163
1:28:39,910 --> 1:28:43,870
He who serves his master with zilos is loved by God.

1164
1:28:43,980 --> 1:28:46,040
True, bright lord!

1165
1:28:46,520 --> 1:28:47,440
Where had he run off to?

1166
1:28:47,510 --> 1:28:49,630
Working as a craftsman's slave.

1167
1:28:49,710 --> 1:28:50,670
In our county?

1168
1:28:50,740 --> 1:28:51,370
No. Ionita found him.

1169
1:28:51,480 --> 1:28:53,340
He shot him, too.

1170
1:28:54,650 --> 1:28:55,870
Aferim, Ionita!

1171
1:28:59,180 --> 1:29:01,140
Good day, bright lord!

1172
1:29:08,680 --> 1:29:11,110
Watch this hawk well.

1173
1:29:11,680 --> 1:29:14,370
It's a gift for Medvedkin.

1174
1:29:14,480 --> 1:29:15,470
Yes, bright lord.

1175
1:29:21,150 --> 1:29:23,010
They caught Carfin, bright lord!

1176
1:29:23,120 --> 1:29:23,910
'Course!

1177
1:29:25,150 --> 1:29:30,580
Gather the crows, the servants and the lady.

1178
1:29:32,020 --> 1:29:35,140
Herd all the crows here!

1179
1:29:38,450 --> 1:29:39,740
Bless you, bright lord!

1180
1:30:08,520 --> 1:30:09,950
And the chibouk.

1181
1:30:17,680 --> 1:30:21,910
Bright lord, how should I put this...

1182
1:30:23,960 --> 1:30:25,890
Right...

1183
1:30:48,150 --> 1:30:50,380
As agreed. Here.

1184
1:30:51,250 --> 1:30:52,950
Thank you!

1185
1:31:05,390 --> 1:31:08,510
We need a writ of receipt for our ruler.

1186
1:31:08,690 --> 1:31:09,880
Of course.

1187
1:31:18,250 --> 1:31:19,810
Where's that feather?

1188
1:31:19,890 --> 1:31:21,860
- Isn't it there?  - It isn't.

1189
1:31:30,560 --> 1:31:33,390
- Here it was.  - You again.

1190
1:31:51,260 --> 1:31:53,350
Bright lord, there's something else.

1191
1:31:54,160 --> 1:31:55,190
Say it.

1192
1:31:56,600 --> 1:32:01,320
I know that this filthy maggot blotted your honour...

1193
1:32:01,760 --> 1:32:05,130
But we've learned he's not the only one guilty.

1194
1:32:05,500 --> 1:32:08,650
He is, but Lady Sultana is more at fault.

1195
1:32:08,860 --> 1:32:12,850
She confessed it herself.

1196
1:32:13,160 --> 1:32:14,860
None of your business.

1197
1:32:15,670 --> 1:32:17,450
Cobbler, stick to your last!

1198
1:32:17,530 --> 1:32:18,790
Of course.

1199
1:32:19,290 --> 1:32:24,130
But 'tis my duty, if I smell trickery...

1200
1:32:24,970 --> 1:32:29,590
Noble lord, whip him,

1201
1:32:30,000 --> 1:32:33,290
just don't kill him.

1202
1:32:34,200 --> 1:32:36,190
Are you seeking trouble?

1203
1:32:37,360 --> 1:32:39,760
Tired of being a lawkeeper here?

1204
1:32:39,830 --> 1:32:41,260
No, bright lord.

1205
1:32:41,770 --> 1:32:42,820
Well, then...

1206
1:32:47,360 --> 1:32:50,300
I was just thinking...

1207
1:32:50,500 --> 1:32:51,460
Wax!

1208
1:33:06,370 --> 1:33:07,330
Take this!

1209
1:33:07,960 --> 1:33:08,990
God bless you.

1210
1:33:14,600 --> 1:33:16,070
Your ishlik, master!

1211
1:33:22,970 --> 1:33:26,030
Sara, come with us!

1212
1:33:26,710 --> 1:33:30,150
He's a smart, hardworking slave...

1213
1:33:30,230 --> 1:33:31,760
- Who?  - Carfin.

1214
1:33:32,470 --> 1:33:34,060
Bring that dagger!

1215
1:33:34,870 --> 1:33:38,590
How about we write Mahmud over in Istanbul?

1216
1:33:38,970 --> 1:33:40,520
- Who?  - We.

1217
1:33:40,800 --> 1:33:42,930
To ask him to award Carfin the Nishan Iftikhar order,

1218
1:33:43,370 --> 1:33:46,130
since he's such a good Gypsy.

1219
1:33:46,570 --> 1:33:50,190
Or the Russians,to give him the Saint Vladimir?

1220
1:33:50,870 --> 1:33:54,670
Psihi-mu, a word with you,if I may.

1221
1:33:55,940 --> 1:33:59,560
What words could you have with me?

1222
1:34:00,000 --> 1:34:02,560
I have thoughts that put me in great turmoil...

1223
1:34:04,340 --> 1:34:09,530
Iordache, please!

1224
1:34:09,600 --> 1:34:12,330
Shedding many a bitter tear For her fun of yester year.

1225
1:34:16,180 --> 1:34:19,290
Where's that Vasile?

1226
1:34:19,370 --> 1:34:21,430
He went to fetch Lady Sultana.

1227
1:34:21,510 --> 1:34:23,030
Tell him to hurry!

1228
1:34:23,540 --> 1:34:26,930
Forgive him, master!

1229
1:34:28,500 --> 1:34:29,600
Take pity!

1230
1:34:29,670 --> 1:34:32,330
What, they forgot the water when they christened you?

1231
1:34:35,480 --> 1:34:37,160
He'll be fine.

1232
1:34:37,240 --> 1:34:39,360
Enough whining!

1233
1:34:39,470 --> 1:34:44,340
May your lady and your bright children live long and happy!

1234
1:34:47,700 --> 1:34:51,800
Are you pleased, agapi-mu, for making me the town's laughingstock?

1235
1:34:52,180 --> 1:34:55,630
Me, your honourable spouse?

1236
1:34:55,950 --> 1:34:57,160
And with a Gypsy, too?!

1237
1:34:58,970 --> 1:35:02,600
Everyone laughs at me like I'm an idiot.

1238
1:35:02,710 --> 1:35:05,800
Even the chickens laugh at me. Even toddlers.

1239
1:35:06,610 --> 1:35:08,160
Get him out of the stocks!

1240
1:35:14,510 --> 1:35:17,400
Vasile! Grab his hands!

1241
1:35:19,140 --> 1:35:22,440
Carfin's, you idiot!

1242
1:35:22,510 --> 1:35:23,640
Get him!

1243
1:35:32,610 --> 1:35:34,440
Oh, Carfin!

1244
1:35:37,240 --> 1:35:41,230
Such a snake I raised by my manor...

1245
1:35:41,350 --> 1:35:42,870
Such a venomous viper...

1246
1:35:45,080 --> 1:35:46,550
Let him be, it wasn't his fault!

1247
1:35:50,010 --> 1:35:53,610
You soiled my life, you crow!

1248
1:35:53,680 --> 1:35:56,050
Forgive me, master, 'tain't my fault!

1249
1:35:56,120 --> 1:35:59,440
I treated you well, like all my slaves.

1250
1:35:59,810 --> 1:36:02,110
I gave you food, I gave you clothing,

1251
1:36:02,480 --> 1:36:05,110
I didn't beat you... And you...

1252
1:36:05,790 --> 1:36:07,170
Venomous asp!

1253
1:36:07,240 --> 1:36:09,730
It was her fault,not mine!

1254
1:36:15,450 --> 1:36:16,910
Don't kill him!

1255
1:36:17,540 --> 1:36:18,070
Help, kind people, he'll kill me!

1256
1:36:22,120 --> 1:36:24,110
Constable, help me!

1257
1:36:25,450 --> 1:36:28,110
Noble lord, better let him get his punishment from the ruler,

1258
1:36:28,280 --> 1:36:29,710
by the law...

1259
1:36:30,080 --> 1:36:32,350
You shut up!

1260
1:36:32,420 --> 1:36:33,880
Out of my sight, worm!

1261
1:36:36,880 --> 1:36:40,340
Vasile! Raise his legs!

1262
1:36:44,790 --> 1:36:45,810
Give me the dagger!

1263
1:36:46,220 --> 1:36:47,840
Raise his cock, too!

1264
1:36:48,680 --> 1:36:49,710
Hold him!

1265
1:36:55,560 --> 1:36:57,540
Bright lord, try with this.

1266
1:37:00,720 --> 1:37:03,650
Hold him!

1267
1:37:12,050 --> 1:37:13,880
That'll teach him!

1268
1:37:14,720 --> 1:37:16,520
Let it be a lesson to you all.

1269
1:37:18,850 --> 1:37:22,120
If you think of doing such things here.

1270
1:37:23,220 --> 1:37:24,550
I'll find out.

1271
1:37:30,690 --> 1:37:32,280
Cut his cock too, master!

1272
1:37:51,820 --> 1:37:55,490
Here, kera-mu, eat his bollocks

1273
1:37:56,500 --> 1:37:59,080
since you were so fond of loving...

1274
1:38:01,790 --> 1:38:04,190
Walk him around town,

1275
1:38:04,630 --> 1:38:06,850
for all to see he's lost his bollocks,

1276
1:38:07,520 --> 1:38:11,050
then bring him back, I have more to discuss with him.

1277
1:38:11,530 --> 1:38:16,920
Then take his wife to the fair and trade her for another,

1278
1:38:16,990 --> 1:38:21,720
I will not see her here again.

1279
1:38:22,260 --> 1:38:23,490
Understood, bright lord.

1280
1:38:23,700 --> 1:38:28,450
Only the law doesn't allow to break apart a clan of slaves...

1281
1:38:28,520 --> 1:38:31,150
That's your job!

1282
1:38:31,930 --> 1:38:33,660
Bribe someone if you must.

1283
1:38:34,260 --> 1:38:35,090
Let's go back home, son.

1284
1:38:35,160 --> 1:38:37,120
Stultus numerus infinitus...

1285
1:39:36,370 --> 1:39:40,260
Come on, fuck it, don't be a rag.

1286
1:39:41,630 --> 1:39:43,190
Be a man, not flesh with eyes!

1287
1:39:43,370 --> 1:39:45,030
I'm fine, father.

1288
1:39:46,560 --> 1:39:48,830
He ain't your fuckin' brother.

1289
1:39:54,100 --> 1:39:56,040
God even looks after worms

1290
1:39:56,110 --> 1:39:57,860
and we can't look after each other...

1291
1:39:59,230 --> 1:40:01,830
This world will stay as it is,

1292
1:40:03,000 --> 1:40:05,400
you can't change it, try as you might.

1293
1:40:06,830 --> 1:40:08,820
We live as we can, not as we want.

1294
1:40:12,240 --> 1:40:14,070
But you'll be fine, my boy.

1295
1:40:14,670 --> 1:40:15,870
I'll get you into the army,

1296
1:40:15,940 --> 1:40:17,450
you'll be a real man.

1297
1:40:17,530 --> 1:40:19,690
You'll live through a war or two, you'll make officer,

1298
1:40:20,170 --> 1:40:22,190
mark my words.

1299
1:40:26,080 --> 1:40:27,330
See?

1300
1:40:29,300 --> 1:40:30,770
Life will be better

1301
1:40:32,970 --> 1:40:34,600
and we'll have a chance to rest.

1302
1:41:09,670 --> 1:41:14,940
Some narrative situations and pieces of dialogue

1303
1:41:15,010 --> 1:41:19,910
have been taken from historical documents
