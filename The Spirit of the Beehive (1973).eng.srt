1
0:01:22,070 --> 0:01:25,230
"Once upon a time..."

2
0:01:29,210 --> 0:01:37,010
"Somewhere on the Castilian plain, around 1940..."

3
0:01:59,270 --> 0:02:03,000
The movie's coming! The movie's coming!

4
0:02:23,260 --> 0:02:25,290
You boys are gonna fall.

5
0:02:26,060 --> 0:02:28,050
How are you?

6
0:02:28,200 --> 0:02:31,000
What are you doing? Get out of here!

7
0:02:40,280 --> 0:02:43,270
Look at all the cans of film!

8
0:02:51,290 --> 0:02:53,280
Let me through.

9
0:02:58,200 --> 0:03:01,060
- What's the movie about? - The movie?

10
0:03:01,130 --> 0:03:03,160
It's wonderful.

11
0:03:03,270 --> 0:03:05,170
Is it a horror movie?

12
0:03:05,240 --> 0:03:07,000
Is that all?

13
0:03:07,100 --> 0:03:09,000
Is it a cowboy movie?

14
0:03:09,110 --> 0:03:10,200
It's a beautiful movie.

15
0:03:10,310 --> 0:03:12,170
Are there Indians in it?

16
0:03:12,210 --> 0:03:16,110
It's tremendous! The best I've ever shown in this town.

17
0:03:16,210 --> 0:03:20,010
You can't even imagine.

18
0:03:20,120 --> 0:03:21,140
All I can say is: ole!

19
0:03:25,020 --> 0:03:28,120
This evening, in the town hall,

20
0:03:28,230 --> 0:03:30,190
at 5:00

21
0:03:30,260 --> 0:03:35,100
there'll be a special showing

22
0:03:35,170 --> 0:03:38,130
of Frankenstein.

23
0:03:38,200 --> 0:03:40,230
Ticket prices will be

24
0:03:40,300 --> 0:03:44,100
one peseta for adults

25
0:03:44,170 --> 0:03:46,970
and two reales for children.

26
0:04:17,170 --> 0:04:19,200
How's it going, Tomasa?

27
0:04:21,010 --> 0:04:22,240
I hope it's good this time.

28
0:04:23,050 --> 0:04:25,140
It's magnificent.

29
0:04:25,220 --> 0:04:27,240
Don't start a fire, now.

30
0:04:28,020 --> 0:04:30,080
Careful with that brazier.

31
0:05:25,240 --> 0:05:29,140
The film's producers do not wish to present it

32
0:05:29,210 --> 0:05:32,150
without a preliminary word of caution.

33
0:05:32,280 --> 0:05:36,050
This is the story of Dr. Frankenstein,

34
0:05:36,250 --> 0:05:38,150
a man of science

35
0:05:38,250 --> 0:05:41,020
who sought to create a living being,

36
0:05:41,090 --> 0:05:44,290
without recognizing that that's something only God can do.

37
0:05:46,060 --> 0:05:50,000
It's one of the strangest stories ever told.

38
0:05:50,230 --> 0:05:53,070
It's about the great mysteries of creation.:

39
0:05:53,300 --> 0:05:55,200
Iife and death.

40
0:05:57,210 --> 0:06:00,010
Prepare yourselves.

41
0:06:00,080 --> 0:06:01,980
You may be shocked,

42
0:06:02,080 --> 0:06:05,070
or even horrified.

43
0:06:06,020 --> 0:06:09,970
Few films have had greater impact all over the world.

44
0:06:10,190 --> 0:06:12,210
But I would advise you

45
0:06:12,290 --> 0:06:15,990
not to take it too seriously.

46
0:07:20,090 --> 0:07:24,250
Though nothing can bring back the happy moments we spent together,

47
0:07:25,200 --> 0:07:29,100
I pray that God grant me the joy of seeing you again.

48
0:07:30,070 --> 0:07:32,060
That's been my constant prayer

49
0:07:32,140 --> 0:07:35,070
ever since we parted during the war,

50
0:07:36,040 --> 0:07:39,130
and it's my prayer still here in this remote spot

51
0:07:39,210 --> 0:07:43,240
where Fernando and the girls and I try to survive.

52
0:07:46,120 --> 0:07:50,210
Little but the walls are left of the house you once knew.

53
0:07:51,220 --> 0:07:56,020
I often wonder what became of everything we had there.

54
0:07:56,230 --> 0:07:58,220
I don't say that out of nostalgia.

55
0:07:59,130 --> 0:08:02,030
It's hard to feel nostalgic

56
0:08:02,100 --> 0:08:05,190
after what we've been through these past few years.

57
0:08:07,070 --> 0:08:09,230
But sometimes, when I look around me

58
0:08:10,010 --> 0:08:12,100
and see so much loss,

59
0:08:12,180 --> 0:08:16,110
so much destruction and so much sadness,

60
0:08:16,280 --> 0:08:20,110
something tells me perhaps our ability to really feel life

61
0:08:20,220 --> 0:08:23,210
has vanished along with all the rest.

62
0:08:25,290 --> 0:08:29,020
I don't even know if this letter will reach you.

63
0:08:29,290 --> 0:08:32,060
The news we get from outside

64
0:08:32,160 --> 0:08:35,130
is so scant and confusing.

65
0:08:36,230 --> 0:08:39,030
Please write soon

66
0:08:39,270 --> 0:08:41,260
to let me know you're still alive.

67
0:08:42,110 --> 0:08:45,070
With all my love, Teresa.

68
0:12:15,080 --> 0:12:16,240
Sit down.

69
0:12:17,150 --> 0:12:19,020
Sit down.

70
0:12:25,160 --> 0:12:27,130
See that? He understands!

71
0:12:28,130 --> 0:12:29,220
Look at that!

72
0:13:45,110 --> 0:13:46,270
Teresa.

73
0:14:07,200 --> 0:14:09,030
Milagros.

74
0:14:09,230 --> 0:14:11,130
Have you seen my wife?

75
0:14:11,200 --> 0:14:13,290
I think she went out a while ago.

76
0:14:15,200 --> 0:14:18,070
- Where are the girls? - At the movie.

77
0:14:18,210 --> 0:14:20,180
Is there anything to eat in the house?

78
0:14:20,280 --> 0:14:22,110
I'm sure there is.

79
0:14:22,180 --> 0:14:24,270
But you should eat regular meals

80
0:14:25,050 --> 0:14:27,020
and come down out of the clouds.

81
0:15:24,240 --> 0:15:27,000
Sit down, Doctor.

82
0:15:27,210 --> 0:15:29,180
Try to be patient.

83
0:15:30,050 --> 0:15:31,240
Did you expect immediate results?

84
0:15:33,020 --> 0:15:36,010
You must keep a close eye on your creature.

85
0:15:36,090 --> 0:15:39,110
Listen to me. It could be dangerous.

86
0:15:40,020 --> 0:15:43,250
Dangerous? You surprise me.

87
0:15:47,260 --> 0:15:50,260
Haven't you ever wanted to take a chance?

88
0:15:51,200 --> 0:15:55,140
What if we never went beyond the limits of the known?

89
0:15:56,010 --> 0:15:59,170
Have you never wished to see beyond the clouds and stars?

90
0:15:59,280 --> 0:16:02,180
Or to know what makes trees grow

91
0:16:02,240 --> 0:16:05,240
and changes shadows to light?

92
0:16:08,150 --> 0:16:12,050
But speak like this and they call you a madman.

93
0:16:14,220 --> 0:16:18,130
Yet if I could answer just one of these questions -

94
0:16:18,260 --> 0:16:21,130
what eternity is, for example -

95
0:16:21,200 --> 0:16:25,220
I wouldn't care if they called me mad.

96
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:29,170
You're young, dazed by your success.

97
0:16:29,270 --> 0:16:32,240
Wake up and see reality.

98
0:16:33,280 --> 0:16:36,040
A demon whose brain -

99
0:16:36,110 --> 0:16:39,080
You must give it time to develop.

100
0:16:39,150 --> 0:16:41,170
It's a perfect brain, Doctor.

101
0:16:42,080 --> 0:16:45,250
I can tell you this now.: It came from your laboratory.

102
0:16:46,160 --> 0:16:49,120
The brain stolen from my laboratory

103
0:16:49,190 --> 0:16:51,090
belonged to a criminal!

104
0:16:52,160 --> 0:16:55,220
- Will you be long, Papa? - No, I'll just fix the wall.

105
0:16:58,030 --> 0:17:00,000
Why don't you stay and play with me?

106
0:17:00,070 --> 0:17:02,160
I have things to do, child.

107
0:17:03,010 --> 0:17:05,100
Play with your kitten.

108
0:17:05,310 --> 0:17:07,280
- Good-bye, Papa. - Good-bye.

109
0:17:08,110 --> 0:17:10,040
And be good.

110
0:17:42,110 --> 0:17:43,170
Who are you?

111
0:17:44,050 --> 0:17:45,170
I'm Maria.

112
0:17:47,050 --> 0:17:49,020
Will you play with me?

113
0:18:03,300 --> 0:18:06,100
Would you like one of my flowers?

114
0:18:29,160 --> 0:18:32,220
This one's for you and this one's for me.

115
0:18:39,100 --> 0:18:41,260
It's like a boat.

116
0:18:42,170 --> 0:18:43,230
See how they float?

117
0:19:07,130 --> 0:19:08,220
Get ready, Maria.

118
0:19:08,300 --> 0:19:10,200
I'll check the roof

119
0:19:10,270 --> 0:19:13,240
and then we'll go to the village.

120
0:20:01,120 --> 0:20:02,110
Isabel.

121
0:20:08,020 --> 0:20:09,180
Why did he kill her?

122
0:20:15,300 --> 0:20:18,060
Why did he kill her?

123
0:20:18,300 --> 0:20:20,130
Silence!

124
0:20:21,300 --> 0:20:24,030
I'll tell you later.

125
0:20:31,110 --> 0:20:33,080
It's Frankenstein!

126
0:20:42,290 --> 0:20:45,260
By the sign of the holy cross

127
0:20:46,030 --> 0:20:49,990
free us from our enemies,

128
0:20:50,100 --> 0:20:52,090
Lord our God.

129
0:20:53,140 --> 0:20:58,230
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen.

130
0:20:59,280 --> 0:21:03,040
Where did you hide the matches?

131
0:21:04,150 --> 0:21:06,010
In the drawer.

132
0:21:31,140 --> 0:21:32,230
What?

133
0:21:33,140 --> 0:21:36,040
Tell me what you were going to tell me.

134
0:21:36,110 --> 0:21:38,270
- About what? - The movie.

135
0:21:39,150 --> 0:21:41,240
Not now. Tomorrow.

136
0:21:42,050 --> 0:21:45,020
Now. You promised.

137
0:21:46,260 --> 0:21:49,020
Why did he kill the girl,

138
0:21:49,060 --> 0:21:51,220
and why did they kill him after that?

139
0:21:56,100 --> 0:21:59,230
You don't know. You're a liar.

140
0:22:00,240 --> 0:22:04,070
They didn't kill him, and he didn't kill the girl.

141
0:22:05,070 --> 0:22:07,100
How do you know?

142
0:22:07,180 --> 0:22:10,040
How do you know they didn't die?

143
0:22:10,280 --> 0:22:13,110
Everything in the movies is fake.

144
0:22:13,180 --> 0:22:15,050
It's all a trick.

145
0:22:15,280 --> 0:22:20,150
Besides, I've seen him alive.

146
0:22:20,290 --> 0:22:22,050
Where?

147
0:22:22,160 --> 0:22:26,090
In a place I know near the village.

148
0:22:27,300 --> 0:22:30,030
People can't see him.

149
0:22:30,100 --> 0:22:32,260
He only comes out at night.

150
0:22:35,300 --> 0:22:38,070
Is he a ghost?

151
0:22:38,310 --> 0:22:41,110
No, he's a spirit.

152
0:22:42,040 --> 0:22:44,310
Like the spirit Dona Lucia talks about?

153
0:22:46,120 --> 0:22:51,080
Yes, but spirits don't have bodies.

154
0:22:52,050 --> 0:22:54,150
That's why you can't kill them.

155
0:22:55,220 --> 0:22:58,020
But he had one in the movie.

156
0:22:58,090 --> 0:23:02,220
He had arms and feet.

157
0:23:03,030 --> 0:23:04,290
He had everything.

158
0:23:05,130 --> 0:23:09,260
It's a disguise they put on when they go outside.

159
0:23:14,180 --> 0:23:19,200
If he only comes out at night, how can you talk to him?

160
0:23:21,080 --> 0:23:24,140
I told you he was a spirit.

161
0:23:24,220 --> 0:23:26,190
If you're his friend,

162
0:23:26,290 --> 0:23:30,220
you can talk to him whenever you want.

163
0:23:30,290 --> 0:23:32,990
Just close your eyes

164
0:23:33,260 --> 0:23:35,230
and call him.

165
0:23:37,070 --> 0:23:38,260
"It's me, Ana."

166
0:23:42,240 --> 0:23:44,070
"It's me, Ana."

167
0:26:22,000 --> 0:26:26,020
"Someone to whom I recently showed my glass beehive,

168
0:26:26,100 --> 0:26:30,200
with its movement like the main gear wheel of a clock-

169
0:26:31,270 --> 0:26:35,230
Someone who saw the constant agitation of the honeycomb,

170
0:26:36,140 --> 0:26:39,270
the mysterious, maddened commotion

171
0:26:40,080 --> 0:26:43,050
of the nurse bees over the nests,

172
0:26:43,150 --> 0:26:47,140
the teeming bridges and stairways of wax,

173
0:26:47,260 --> 0:26:50,050
the invading spirals of the queen,

174
0:26:51,060 --> 0:26:54,190
the endlessly varied and repetitive labors of the swarm,

175
0:26:54,300 --> 0:26:57,160
the relentless yet ineffectual toil,

176
0:26:57,300 --> 0:27:00,270
the fevered comings and goings,

177
0:27:01,140 --> 0:27:03,100
the call to sleep always ignored,

178
0:27:03,170 --> 0:27:06,070
undermining the next day's work,

179
0:27:06,210 --> 0:27:08,230
the final repose of death

180
0:27:09,180 --> 0:27:13,200
far from a place that tolerates neither sickness nor tombs -

181
0:27:16,080 --> 0:27:18,990
Someone who observed these things,

182
0:27:19,050 --> 0:27:21,020
after the initial astonishment had passed,

183
0:27:21,120 --> 0:27:23,180
quickly looked away

184
0:27:23,230 --> 0:27:26,990
with an expression of indescribable sadness and horror. "

185
0:31:13,220 --> 0:31:15,990
Two and two is four

186
0:31:16,090 --> 0:31:19,150
Four and two is six

187
0:31:19,290 --> 0:31:25,030
Six and two is eight Plus eight is 16

188
0:31:25,170 --> 0:31:30,130
Plus eight is 24 Plus eight is 32

189
0:31:31,010 --> 0:31:35,270
Holy souls, we kneel before you.

190
0:31:36,040 --> 0:31:38,980
AII right. Put away your things.

191
0:31:44,190 --> 0:31:46,020
Quiet!

192
0:31:54,030 --> 0:31:55,160
Quiet!

193
0:31:56,060 --> 0:31:58,120
Or else Don Jose will get angry.

194
0:32:12,150 --> 0:32:14,170
Good morning, Don Jose.

195
0:32:17,290 --> 0:32:19,150
Poor Don Jose!

196
0:32:20,020 --> 0:32:21,180
Who left him like that?

197
0:32:21,290 --> 0:32:24,050
You did, teacher!

198
0:32:24,160 --> 0:32:26,060
Let's see, Paulita.

199
0:32:26,130 --> 0:32:28,150
What is Don Jose missing?

200
0:32:28,230 --> 0:32:31,100
- His heart. - Good. Put it on him.

201
0:32:39,170 --> 0:32:41,010
Mari Carmen,

202
0:32:41,140 --> 0:32:43,130
what's the heart for?

203
0:32:47,250 --> 0:32:49,220
For breathing.

204
0:32:51,090 --> 0:32:55,050
All you smarty-pants laughing so hard,

205
0:32:55,120 --> 0:32:57,020
what do we breathe with?

206
0:32:57,130 --> 0:32:59,090
The lungs.

207
0:32:59,130 --> 0:33:01,060
Show them to us.

208
0:33:05,070 --> 0:33:06,160
Put his lungs on.

209
0:33:09,040 --> 0:33:10,230
Put them on him.

210
0:33:17,250 --> 0:33:19,040
Very good.

211
0:33:19,250 --> 0:33:21,240
What is the stomach for?

212
0:33:22,020 --> 0:33:24,110
To put food in.

213
0:33:24,220 --> 0:33:25,280
Put it on him.

214
0:33:31,130 --> 0:33:33,090
Very good. Sit down.

215
0:33:33,190 --> 0:33:35,060
Now pay attention.

216
0:33:35,130 --> 0:33:39,000
Don Jose can walk. He can breathe.

217
0:33:39,070 --> 0:33:40,190
He can eat.

218
0:33:41,140 --> 0:33:42,230
But...

219
0:33:45,170 --> 0:33:50,200
there's still something very, very important

220
0:33:50,280 --> 0:33:52,110
that's missing.

221
0:33:53,280 --> 0:33:54,270
His bones.

222
0:33:55,120 --> 0:33:57,050
His ears.

223
0:33:57,090 --> 0:33:58,050
Ana.

224
0:33:59,020 --> 0:34:00,150
You're very quiet.

225
0:34:01,260 --> 0:34:03,220
What is Don Jose still missing?

226
0:34:06,160 --> 0:34:07,220
His eyes.

227
0:34:08,030 --> 0:34:09,090
Quiet, Isabel.

228
0:34:09,160 --> 0:34:11,160
Answer when I ask you.

229
0:34:12,130 --> 0:34:14,120
- His eyes. - Very good.

230
0:34:15,100 --> 0:34:17,090
Come and put them on him.

231
0:34:37,090 --> 0:34:40,120
Now Don Jose can see.

232
0:34:41,230 --> 0:34:44,060
See the house with the well?

233
0:34:44,170 --> 0:34:46,220
- Does he Iive there? - Yes.

234
0:34:47,100 --> 0:34:49,090
You want to go there?

235
0:34:49,270 --> 0:34:51,030
AII right.

236
0:36:15,160 --> 0:36:17,020
Isabel!

237
0:40:04,220 --> 0:40:07,150
Mama asked about you this afternoon.

238
0:40:11,060 --> 0:40:13,150
She wanted to know where you were.

239
0:40:17,270 --> 0:40:21,100
I said you were still at school.

240
0:40:25,140 --> 0:40:27,070
Did you go to the well?

241
0:40:28,140 --> 0:40:29,230
Yes.

242
0:40:30,210 --> 0:40:32,080
Did you see him?

243
0:40:37,020 --> 0:40:38,210
Because he doesn't know you.

244
0:40:41,190 --> 0:40:42,180
Papa's coming!

245
0:40:43,120 --> 0:40:44,250
Papa's coming!

246
0:40:59,170 --> 0:41:01,140
Papa, here's one.

247
0:41:28,140 --> 0:41:31,100
- Papa, here's another one. - I'm coming.

248
0:41:34,040 --> 0:41:35,030
It's bad.

249
0:41:35,140 --> 0:41:37,170
How much you wanna bet?

250
0:41:37,250 --> 0:41:39,110
Don't touch it.

251
0:41:43,180 --> 0:41:46,050
- It's good, isn't it? - Let's see.

252
0:41:51,290 --> 0:41:53,230
Yes, sir, that's a good mushroom.

253
0:41:53,290 --> 0:41:55,090
See?

254
0:41:56,000 --> 0:41:58,190
Who knows what it's called?

255
0:41:59,170 --> 0:42:01,230
- A brittlegill. - A flyswatter.

256
0:42:02,040 --> 0:42:04,270
No, flyswatters are poisonous.

257
0:42:07,240 --> 0:42:08,300
Look closely.

258
0:42:10,280 --> 0:42:12,080
Trum... - Trumpet!

259
0:42:12,180 --> 0:42:13,150
Very good.

260
0:42:14,180 --> 0:42:17,170
You can tell by the brown color

261
0:42:18,120 --> 0:42:20,110
and these wavy edges.

262
0:42:24,030 --> 0:42:27,050
Papa, have you ever picked a poisonous mushroom?

263
0:42:27,130 --> 0:42:29,150
- No. You know why? - Why?

264
0:42:29,230 --> 0:42:32,100
Because I always do Iike my grandfather told me.

265
0:42:35,270 --> 0:42:39,100
If you're not sure a mushroom's good, don't pick it.

266
0:42:39,310 --> 0:42:43,240
Because if it's bad and you eat it,

267
0:42:44,050 --> 0:42:48,070
it's your Iast mushroom, and your Iast everything else too.

268
0:42:48,180 --> 0:42:50,240
You two understand? - I do.

269
0:42:52,120 --> 0:42:54,990
Grandfather wasn't crazy about eating them.

270
0:42:55,120 --> 0:42:57,180
What he Iiked was Iooking for them,

271
0:42:57,290 --> 0:43:00,160
even if it meant a full day's hike.

272
0:43:00,260 --> 0:43:02,230
He never got tired.

273
0:43:04,030 --> 0:43:05,090
See that mountain?

274
0:43:06,170 --> 0:43:09,100
What he called "the mushroom garden" is up there.

275
0:43:10,000 --> 0:43:12,060
You know why? - Why?

276
0:43:12,140 --> 0:43:15,110
Because the best mushroom grows there - the chanterelle.

277
0:43:15,240 --> 0:43:18,230
- Why don't we go? - It's too far.

278
0:43:19,050 --> 0:43:22,020
We'd never make it with you two weaklings.

279
0:43:22,080 --> 0:43:24,020
We'II go some other day.

280
0:43:24,090 --> 0:43:26,180
But first you have to promise

281
0:43:27,020 --> 0:43:29,080
never to tell your mother.

282
0:43:49,140 --> 0:43:51,010
Look what we have here.

283
0:43:52,310 --> 0:43:55,010
A real devil.

284
0:43:55,120 --> 0:43:56,280
It smells so good.

285
0:43:57,080 --> 0:43:59,210
Sure, the young ones fool you,

286
0:43:59,250 --> 0:44:02,090
but the older ones are a different story.

287
0:44:03,060 --> 0:44:04,990
Look very closely.

288
0:44:06,060 --> 0:44:08,190
Look at the color of the cap

289
0:44:09,260 --> 0:44:12,130
and the black gills.

290
0:44:13,130 --> 0:44:16,190
Never forget, girls: This is the worst of all.

291
0:44:16,240 --> 0:44:18,210
The most poisonous.

292
0:44:19,110 --> 0:44:23,170
Whoever eats this hasn't got a chance in the world.

293
0:44:53,270 --> 0:44:55,110
Fernando.

294
0:44:59,210 --> 0:45:01,040
See you Iater.

295
0:45:09,220 --> 0:45:12,090
- Good morning, Don Fernando. - Good morning.

296
0:45:12,160 --> 0:45:14,060
We're getting a Iate start.

297
0:46:04,110 --> 0:46:06,980
- You hit me! - I did not!

298
0:46:11,250 --> 0:46:15,050
That's enough! Stop being so boisterous.

299
0:46:16,220 --> 0:46:18,990
- Dummy! - Pig!

300
0:46:20,230 --> 0:46:22,200
Good Lord!

301
0:46:22,260 --> 0:46:24,090
What's all this ruckus?

302
0:46:24,170 --> 0:46:26,100
- She started it. - That's enough!

303
0:46:26,200 --> 0:46:28,070
She's Iying.

304
0:46:28,140 --> 0:46:31,160
Come on. It's time to wash up for school.

305
0:46:32,110 --> 0:46:34,200
First you get the brush wet.

306
0:46:35,240 --> 0:46:37,040
Okay.

307
0:46:37,180 --> 0:46:39,200
Then you rub it all over your face.

308
0:46:46,150 --> 0:46:48,210
Then you get it soapy.

309
0:46:52,090 --> 0:46:54,120
Now you rub it on your face.

310
0:47:03,240 --> 0:47:05,030
Okay.

311
0:47:05,270 --> 0:47:08,040
Now I shave off the Iittle hairs?

312
0:47:08,110 --> 0:47:12,010
Yes, and then you put on some cologne.

313
0:47:21,120 --> 0:47:24,090
Mama, do you know what a spirit is?

314
0:47:28,100 --> 0:47:30,150
You don't know and I do.

315
0:47:31,100 --> 0:47:33,090
A spirit is a spirit.

316
0:47:33,200 --> 0:47:35,260
Are they good or bad?

317
0:47:36,040 --> 0:47:38,100
With good Iittle girls, they're very good,

318
0:47:38,170 --> 0:47:41,140
but with bad girls, they're very bad.

319
0:47:43,240 --> 0:47:46,010
But you're always a good girl, aren't you?

320
0:47:46,180 --> 0:47:48,150
Give me a kiss.

321
0:48:12,140 --> 0:48:14,040
It's coming!

322
0:49:34,190 --> 0:49:36,180
"Now neither malice nor hatred,

323
0:49:36,290 --> 0:49:38,220
nor even the fear of change.

324
0:49:38,290 --> 0:49:40,160
I only feel thirst,

325
0:49:40,190 --> 0:49:43,060
a thirst for I know not what.

326
0:49:44,060 --> 0:49:46,190
Rivers of Iife, where have you gone?

327
0:49:46,230 --> 0:49:48,260
Air, I need air.

328
0:49:49,040 --> 0:49:53,170
What do you see in the darkness that makes you silently tremble?

329
0:49:53,310 --> 0:49:56,070
I see not but only stare Iike a blind man

330
0:49:56,210 --> 0:49:58,140
facing straight into the sun.

331
0:49:58,250 --> 0:50:03,010
I shall fall where the fallen never rise."

332
0:51:47,250 --> 0:51:50,050
"To... my...

333
0:51:50,120 --> 0:51:51,990
dear...

334
0:51:52,190 --> 0:51:55,250
misanthrope."

335
0:54:07,190 --> 0:54:09,160
Come here.

336
0:55:23,040 --> 0:55:25,030
What's wrong with you?

337
0:58:42,170 --> 0:58:45,190
Come on, get up. Stop playing around.

338
0:59:56,140 --> 0:59:58,240
He's not here anymore. He's gone.

339
1:00:40,250 --> 1:00:44,160
Isabel, tell me what happened.

340
1:01:32,270 --> 1:01:34,170
Milagros!

341
1:04:15,200 --> 1:04:18,190
- Careful, you'II get burnt. - Isabel!

342
1:04:18,270 --> 1:04:20,170
Careful, Raquel.

343
1:05:36,150 --> 1:05:38,120
What are you doing here, child?

344
1:05:38,250 --> 1:05:41,190
Come on, Iet's go.

345
1:05:42,220 --> 1:05:45,280
Let's go home. Your father's back.

346
1:05:48,160 --> 1:05:49,990
Let's go.

347
1:05:50,130 --> 1:05:52,260
Come on, Iet's go.

348
1:09:31,020 --> 1:09:32,990
Where were you?

349
1:09:43,260 --> 1:09:45,200
Where were you?

350
1:10:58,170 --> 1:10:59,260
Here.

351
1:14:07,230 --> 1:14:09,090
Hello.

352
1:14:11,030 --> 1:14:12,160
Come in.

353
1:14:18,100 --> 1:14:20,160
- May l, sir? - Come in.

354
1:14:22,110 --> 1:14:24,230
- He's here. - I'II be right there.

355
1:20:46,020 --> 1:20:47,180
Ana, come here!

356
1:27:35,200 --> 1:27:37,230
Get back!

357
1:27:48,110 --> 1:27:50,210
Ana, what happened to you?

358
1:28:16,210 --> 1:28:20,080
- Miguel, how is she? - Fine. Still a Iittle weak.

359
1:28:20,280 --> 1:28:23,270
She hardly sleeps. She won't eat or speak.

360
1:28:24,080 --> 1:28:25,980
Light bothers her.

361
1:28:27,020 --> 1:28:30,040
She Iooks our way but doesn't recognize us.

362
1:28:31,020 --> 1:28:33,180
It's as if we didn't exist.

363
1:28:43,100 --> 1:28:47,000
Ana is still a very small child.

364
1:28:47,170 --> 1:28:51,040
She's under the effect of a powerful experience.

365
1:28:51,280 --> 1:28:53,210
But she'II get over it.

366
1:28:56,180 --> 1:28:57,240
Really, Miguel?

367
1:28:59,120 --> 1:29:03,080
Bit by bit she'II begin to forget.

368
1:29:06,190 --> 1:29:09,250
The important thing is that your daughter's alive.

369
1:29:10,060 --> 1:29:11,260
She's alive.

370
1:29:22,240 --> 1:29:24,040
She's gone to sleep.

371
1:29:24,110 --> 1:29:26,080
Don Miguel, she's asleep.

372
1:29:26,140 --> 1:29:28,980
Give her this medicine. The dose is right here.

373
1:29:29,080 --> 1:29:32,050
Yes, sir. I'II go right to the pharmacy.

374
1:29:34,050 --> 1:29:37,080
She should eat. Something easy to digest.

375
1:29:37,160 --> 1:29:39,180
Soup without too much fat,

376
1:29:40,060 --> 1:29:42,050
a boiled egg.

377
1:29:44,130 --> 1:29:47,100
And you need rest too, Teresa,

378
1:29:47,200 --> 1:29:49,220
as much as she does.

379
1:29:50,270 --> 1:29:55,070
If anything happens, send Milagros for me. I'II come right away.

380
1:29:55,140 --> 1:29:57,010
Yes, Miguel.

381
1:31:59,230 --> 1:32:03,190
Someone to whom I recently showed my glass beehive,

382
1:32:04,040 --> 1:32:08,130
with its movement like the main gear wheel of a clock-

383
1:32:09,140 --> 1:32:13,100
Someone who saw the constant agitation of the honeycomb,

384
1:32:13,310 --> 1:32:17,150
the mysterious, maddened commotion

385
1:32:17,220 --> 1:32:20,150
of the nurse bees over the nests,

386
1:32:21,050 --> 1:32:24,150
the teeming bridges and stairways of wax,

387
1:32:25,160 --> 1:32:28,020
the invading spirals...

388
1:35:13,160 --> 1:35:15,130
If you're his friend,

389
1:35:15,190 --> 1:35:19,130
you can talk to him whenever you want.

390
1:35:19,230 --> 1:35:21,220
Just close your eyes

391
1:35:22,000 --> 1:35:24,130
and call him.

392
1:35:26,000 --> 1:35:27,230
"It's me, Ana. "

393
1:35:31,210 --> 1:35:33,110
"It's me, Ana. "
