我想要你负起责任来 - 那就好啊

总有一天 我不会再有任何感觉…
One day, I won't have feelings anymore...

87
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:44,710
我感觉就像 我精神上依赖着别人的谎言
I'll feel like being on psychotropics, dependent on other peoples lies.

88

公车没来 - 你骑车去的…

为什么

144
0:21:50,480 --> 0:21:53,790
如果你没把洋娃娃放进爸爸的提琴箱…
If you hadn't put your doll in Dad's case...

145
0:21:55,360 --> 0:21:59,990
没关系的 妈妈 爸爸向汉斯借了一把小提琴

但是不要跟他说是我告诉你的 - 什么

爸爸早些时候在电话里跟我讲的

150
0:22:18,360 --> 0:22:21,550
看到了吗 现在生我的气 即使不关我的事
See? Now you're cross with me, even though it's not my fault.

151
0:22:24,440 --> 0:22:25,950
胡说八道
Nonsense!

152
0:22:26,360 --> 0:22:28,510
哎呀 - 他说了什么
Ouch! - What did he say?

153
0:22:28,920 --> 0:22:31,630
他发现了我的洋娃娃在提琴箱里…
That he found my doll in the case...

154
0:22:31,720 --> 0:22:36,350
他没有生气 因为他从汉斯那儿借到一把提琴
and that he wasn't angry, because he could borrow a violin from Hanns.

155
0:22:36,640 --> 0:22:37,780

386
0:51:20,800 --> 0:51:25,270
我就不知道 为什么你从没跟我说过

387
0:51:25,360 --> 0:51:27,590
我告诉你了 我以为你是蕾丝边

我必须跟你父亲讲 参加试演… 我做不到
I have to talk to your father, what to play at the audition... I can't do it.

如果我在做梦 此刻请将我唤醒…

在梦中你从不会问 我是否在做梦

Please comfort me.

468
0:58:04,080 --> 0:58:05,950
过来
Come!

469
0:58:15,800 --> 0:58:17,630
我不不知道我为何还在这里…
I don't know why I'm still here...

470
0:58:18,360 --> 0:58:20,740
恩 那么回家去吧 小猫…
Well, then go home, kitten...

471
0:58:22,080 --> 0:58:25,030
我想和他谈谈 -几时
I want to talk with him! - When?

472
0:58:25,960 --> 0:58:27,550
在这里 现在吗
Here? Now?

473
0:58:31,160 --> 0:58:34,310
怎么了 - 没什么 一切总会好转
What's wrong? - No, everything is alright.

474
0:58:36,120 --> 0:58:39,270
我将重蹈妈妈的覆辙
I'm going to have the same life as Mum.

475
0:58:41,000 --> 0:58:44,350
抱歉 但你对我来说太沉了
Sorry, but you're too heavy for me!

476
0:58:45,720 --> 0:58:50,840
我将像她一样 抑郁地坐在屋里 吓唬着孩子
I'll be like her, sitting depressed at home, terrorising the children.

477
0:58:52,840 --> 0:58:58,190
你妈妈是个病妇 你… 有天赋 你有乐器
Your mother is a sick woman. You... have talent. You have an instrument.

478
0:58:58,280 --> 0:58:59,830
妈妈也一样
So did Mum.

479
0:59:00,480 --> 0:59:04,390
她抚养了两个孩子 她曾经可以拥有事业如果你让
She raised two kids. If you had done that, she could have had a career.

480
0:59:04,480 --> 0:59:06,310
抱歉 亲爱的 你不清楚这事
Sorry, darling. You're confusing the matter.

481
0:59:06,400 --> 0:59:10,630
我遇见你妈时 我完全知道我想要什么 但她不是
When I met your mother, I knew exactly what I wanted. She did not!

482
0:59:10,720 --> 0:59:13,390
她没有胆量 你本可以支持她
She didn't dare. You could have supported her!

483
0:59:13,480 --> 0:59:16,590
我必须顾及我自己 那时候才刚起步
I had to look after myself. It was only the beginning.

484
0:59:17,240 --> 0:59:19,150
而接着她有了一个孩子
And then she had a child.

485
0:59:20,200 --> 0:59:24,110
是你们俩有了一个孩子 那是我
Both of you had a child! That was ME!

486
0:59:27,320 --> 0:59:29,270
拜托 坐下来吧
Come on, sit down.

487
0:59:29,920 --> 0:59:34,860
我们再多待会儿 看 是焰火
We still have so much time together. Look, the fireworks.

488
1:00:42,440 --> 1:00:43,580
玛丽
Marie?

489
1:00:44,760 --> 1:00:47,670

Thomas, I begin...

490
1:00:53,840 --> 1:00:56,830
赫尔穆特 你现在必须回家去了 - 是啊 是啊
Helmut, you have to go home now! - Yes, yes.

491
1:01:00,480 --> 1:01:02,350
他们真棒 是吧
They are great, hm?

492
1:02:49,440 --> 1:02:51,950
站起来 别跌倒了…
Stand up! Don't fall...

493
1:02:52,720 --> 1:02:55,630
我该怎么从这里出去 - 这里没有出口
How do I get out of here? - There is no way out.

494
1:02:56,600 --> 1:02:58,430
你叫什么名字 - 乔纳森
What's your name? - Jonathan.

495
1:02:58,800 --> 1:03:02,230
乔纳森 抱紧我
Jonathan, hold me tight.

496
1:03:21,120 --> 1:03:22,070
乔纳森
Jonathan!

497
1:03:29,520 --> 1:03:33,030
你怎么回事 你想折磨我吗
What's wrong? Do you want to wear me down?

498
1:03:34,000 --> 1:03:35,430
看看你的所作所为
And the way you look!

499
1:03:35,840 --> 1:03:38,070
你的袜子在哪儿
And where is your sock?

500
1:03:39,440 --> 1:03:42,230
什么 你喝醉了吗 - 你这混蛋
What? Are you drunk? - You bastard!

501
1:03:43,320 --> 1:03:46,190
你对我的人生做了什么
What did you do to my life?!

502
1:03:49,320 --> 1:03:51,670
不 我离开 - 玛丽
No, I'm leaving! - Marie!

503
1:03:52,320 --> 1:03:55,310
希望你们俩会对你们的所作所为感到快乐 而且尿在彼此身上
Hope you'll both be happy with what you did, and piss on each other!

504
1:03:55,440 --> 1:03:58,150
为什么你不在家 孩子们在哪儿
Why aren't you home? Where are the children?

505
1:03:58,280 --> 1:04:01,820
好像你真的在意似的 - 你妈妈和他们在一起吧…
As if that would interest you THAT much! - Your mother is with them...

506
1:04:02,200 --> 1:04:03,830
你他妈的闭嘴
Shut the fuck up!

507
1:04:04,000 --> 1:04:08,470
很好 我们能回到这个问题上吗 你妈妈有没有和他们在一起
Fine, we can go on talking like this. Is your mother with them?

508
1:04:09,000 --> 1:04:11,270
只有他们俩
They are alone.

509
1:04:11,680 --> 1:04:14,830
他们睡着了而且再不会醒来
They sleep and will never wake up again.

510
1:04:15,240 --> 1:04:20,030
而且在解决了你之后 我再自刎
And after I'm through with you, I'll slash myself!

511
1:04:20,760 --> 1:04:23,950
你完全疯了 我一个字都不敢相信
You are totally crazy! I don't believe a single word!

512
1:04:24,320 --> 1:04:26,910
你好 再见 没事了现在…
Yes, bye, it's over...

513
1:04:37,280 --> 1:04:38,790
我的孩子们…
My little ones...

514
1:04:40,520 --> 1:04:43,390
我希望他们仍安睡着…
I hope they're still asleep...

515
1:04:45,040 --> 1:04:48,950
当然 他们都睡着了
Sure. They're asleep.

516
1:04:50,240 --> 1:04:52,270
告诉我这些都结束了…
Tell me that it'll be over...

517
1:04:52,360 --> 1:04:55,870
说你爱我 跟我说一切都会好起来…
Say that you love me, tell me that everything will be fine...

518
1:04:55,960 --> 1:04:59,270
哭 总是哭…
The crying... Always the crying...

519
1:05:01,440 --> 1:05:04,870
如果你总哭那要怎么才说得清
One can't talk, if you always cry.

520
1:05:05,520 --> 1:05:07,310
你们都一样
You're all the same.

521
1:05:07,680 --> 1:05:09,230
你个鸡巴
Penis!

522

是啊 这就是你所想的
Yeah, that's what you think.

524
1:05:16,960 --> 1:05:20,270
但是你错了 亲爱的 你都错了
But you are wrong, my dear. All of you are wrong.

525
1:05:20,840 --> 1:05:23,590
你不明白 但你对此无能为力
You don't understand. But you can't help it!

526
1:05:23,680 --> 1:05:29,150
它就在你体内 你被迫怀生育…
It's inside of you! You're compelled to procreate...

527
1:05:29,240 --> 1:05:32,550
它胜过了你的理智 别人必须就要迁就着你
it's stronger than your intellect. One has to be careful with you.

528
1:05:35,280 --> 1:05:37,070
有任何人问过我吗
Did anybody ask me?

529
1:05:37,360 --> 1:05:40,900
有 我问过 - 然后我怎么说
Yes, I did! - And what did I say?

530
1:05:42,360 --> 1:05:45,430
操 妈的
Fuck, shit!

531
1:05:45,560 --> 1:05:47,710
我不想那些
I didn't want that!

532
1:05:49,040 --> 1:05:51,790
但那不重要了 那不是我的全部
But that doesn't matter. It wasn't about me at all.

533
1:05:51,880 --> 1:05:55,030
你只想着你那愚蠢的浪漫 为人母的感觉
You just wanted your stupid romantic, motherly feelings!

534
1:05:55,760 --> 1:05:57,990
来 站起来 你必须控制住你自己
Come, get up. You have to get hold of yourself.

535
1:05:58,480 --> 1:06:00,860
我带孩子们度假 你也会有所好转的
I take the children with me on holiday, and you get better.

536
1:06:01,160 --> 1:06:04,510
别从我身旁带走孩子 - 停止胡闹
Don't take the children away from me. - Stop this nonsense!

537
1:06:04,600 --> 1:06:08,270
去度假吧 到海边旅行 休息一下
Go on holiday too, travel to the sea. Get some rest.

538
1:06:08,600 --> 1:06:11,510
带上女伴 萨布里娜怎么样
Take a girlfriend. What about Sabrina?

539
1:06:11,920 --> 1:06:14,590
我什么都没了 我什么都不想…
I've got nothing. I... I don't want anything.

540
1:06:15,520 --> 1:06:18,030
都结束了 是吗
It's over, isn't it?

541
1:06:38,520 --> 1:06:40,270
是他干的
He did it.

542
1:06:46,920 --> 1:06:49,630
林中房屋失火了
The forester's house is burning!

543
1:07:06,960 --> 1:07:07,940
玛丽
Marie?

544
1:07:08,040 --> 1:07:10,550
快过来 不会有事的
Come on, this won't lead to anything today.

545
1:07:10,640 --> 1:07:12,750
感谢上帝 我们提早拿到了报酬
Thank heavens that we got paid in advance!

546
1:07:13,240 --> 1:07:16,310
她走了 - 是吗 你送走她的吗
She's gone! - Well, you did send her away.

547
1:07:17,160 --> 1:07:19,270
她那么愤怒…
She was so angry...

548
1:07:19,360 --> 1:07:23,110
是啊 每天都是 当你有了自己的演奏会的时候 女人都这样
Yes, today of all days. When you had your concert. Typical woman!

549
1:07:42,320 --> 1:07:44,910
楼下有很多鬼魂
Under the stairs is a lot of spirit.

550
1:07:45,520 --> 1:07:49,470
如果你想 我可以帮你把它们都烧毁
If you want, I can help you burn it all down.

551
1:07:52,440 --> 1:07:54,740

你有孩子吗
Do you have children?

559
1:11:23,400 --> 1:11:27,670
我发觉有些欣慰的是你不想和我睡觉
I find it comforting that you don't want to sleep with me.

560
